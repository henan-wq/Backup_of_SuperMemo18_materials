<P>Postcards always spoil my holidays.<BR>Last summer, I went to Italy.<BR>I visited museums and sat in public gardens.<BR>A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian.<BR>Then he lent me a book. <BR>I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word.<BR>Every day I thought about postcards.<BR>My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends.<BR>On the last day I made a big decision.<BR>I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards.<BR>I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!
