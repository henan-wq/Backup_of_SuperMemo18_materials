<P>Fishing is my favourite sport.<BR>I often fish for hours without catching anything.<BR>But this does not worry me.<BR>Some fishermen are unlucky.<BR>Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish.<BR>I am even less lucky.<BR>I never catch anything -- not even old boots.<BR>After having spent whole mornings on the river,<BR>I always go home with an empty bag.<BR>'You must give up fishing!' my friends say.<BR>'It's a waste of time.'<BR>But they don't realize one important thing.<BR>I'm not really interested in fishing.<BR>I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!
