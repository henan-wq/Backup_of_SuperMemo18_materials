<P>Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.<BR>Nearly everybody enters for &#8216;The Nicest Garden Competition&#8217; each year, but Joe wins every time.<BR>Bill Frith&#8217;s garden is larger than Joe&#8217;s.<BR>Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe&#8217;s garden is more interesting.<BR>He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.<BR>I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.<BR>Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!
