<P>There is a car race near our town every year.<BR>In 1995, there was a very big race.</P>
<P>There were hundreds of people there.<BR>My wife and I were at the race.<BR>Our friends Julie and Jack were there, too.<BR>You can see us in the crowd.<BR>We are standing on the left.</P>
<P>There were twenty cars in the race.<BR>There were English cars, French cars,<BR>German cars, Italian cars,<BR>American cars and Japanese cars.</P>
<P>It was an exciting finish.<BR>The winner was Billy Stewart.<BR>He was in car number fifteen.<BR>Five other cars were just behind him.</P>
<P>On the way home, my wife said to me,<BR>'Don't drive so quickly!<BR>You're not Billy Stewart!'
