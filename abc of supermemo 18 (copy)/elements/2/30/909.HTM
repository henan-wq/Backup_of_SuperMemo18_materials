<P>On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall.<BR>It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock.<BR>It would strike twelve in twenty minutes&#8217; time.<BR>Fifteen minutes passed and then, at five to twelve, the clock stopped.<BR>The big minute hand did not move.<BR>We waited and waited, but nothing happened.<BR>Suddenly someone shouted, &#8216;It&#8217;s two minutes past twelve! The clock has stopped!&#8217;<BR>I looked at my watch.<BR>It was true.<BR>The big clock refused to welcome the New Year.<BR>At that moment, everybody began to laugh and sing.
