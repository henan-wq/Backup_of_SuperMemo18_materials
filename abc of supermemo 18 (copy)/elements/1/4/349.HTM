<strong><font color="blue">Priority queue : </font></strong>Can we learn the entire Encyclopedia Britannica?</SPAN></H2>
<P>Early in the learning process, many students do not bother to prioritize their learning material. This attitude is caused by two factors: </P>
<UL>
<LI>smaller volume of memorized material early in the process (and lesser cost of review) 
<LI>false conviction that human memory is vast enough to hold all that dream knowledge</LI></UL>
<P>Do you think you are able to memorize the entire <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</A> line by line, fact for fact? </P>
<P>Chances are your answer might be: <I>"I might be too lazy, I might be too busy, but if I had all the time of my day for the job, I would"</I>. Or perhaps <I>"I might not, but I have heard of geniuses able to do it! How about <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek">Kim Peek</A>?"</I>. If you believe the encyclopedia is within the realm of possible, you will soon realize that you desperately need the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="18">priority queue</A> to help you overcome a big surprise: our memory is far more limited than you think! </P>
<P>Assuming we do not deal with humans affected with a mutation to their memory system, memorizing <A class="external text" href="https://britannica.com">Britannica</A> would falsify the <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm">theory of SuperMemo</A> which should apply to all healthy adults. In the light of SuperMemo, memorizing <A class="external text" href="https://britannica.com">Britannica</A> verges on impossible. There are 44 million words in Britannica's 32 volumes. This translates to 6 million SuperMemo <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="19">items</A> ("human memory bits") assuming the average keyword extraction on information dense texts as 1:7. Assuming a 50-year learning span, we get to 18,250 days and 330 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="20">items</A> per day. Assuming optimum representation of knowledge (say <A class="external text" href="https://britannica.com">Britannica</A> is already "<A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation">perfectly formulated</A>") you cannot learn faster for a given level of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="21">knowledge retention</A> than with SuperMemo (it simply finds the mathematical optimum). Practice shows it is very difficult to sustain more than 100 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="22">items</A> per day in the long run with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="23">retention</A> around 95%. In other words, for an intelligent man, for perfectly formulated Britannica knowledge, with SuperMemo, you are hardly able to accomplish the goal with your whole life devoted to the task!
