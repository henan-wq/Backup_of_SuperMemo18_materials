<strong><font color="blue">Priority queue : </font></strong>Volume vs. retention battle in learning</SPAN></H2>
<P><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="24">Incremental reading</A> makes it easy to import large volumes of learning material from the Internet. By default, all imported material enters the learning process. As a result, large volumes of unprocessed information begin to compete for your attention with most important pieces of knowledge that you decided to remember. It is a clash of priorities. On one hand you want to ensure high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="25">retention</A> of your mission-critical knowledge (as in classical SuperMemo), on the other, you want to devour more and more new knowledge. </P>
<P>Before SuperMemo, your learning would largely be based on reading and reviewing books or your own notes. With older SuperMemos, you would divide your time between reading (on paper) and repetitions (on the computer). With <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="26">incremental reading</A>, those competing processes were blended into one. You can read and review concurrently in SuperMemo. However, for the most avid incremental readers, the balance of priority will always dangerously shift in favor of new reading at the cost of the previously acquired knowledge. This comes from human nature. New reading provides instant gratification: <I>"Today, I have learned something new. I am wiser now"</I>. Reviewing the material you already know will always feel like a burden. We are always unhappy with our forgetful memory. It always feels that the nature should have given us a natural choice of what to forget and what to remember without the painful effort of reviewing what we already know. </P>
<P>To settle the Volume-vs-Retention battle and to resolve the perpetual clash of priorities, you need better weapons than those made available by older SuperMemos. Before the arrival of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="27">priority queue</A> (2006), you would need to use a complex set of tools to employ massive learning and still protect the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="28">retention</A> of your most important knowledge. You would use complex concepts such as <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="29">A-Factors</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Forgetting_index" oldtitle="Glossary:Forgetting index" data-hasqtip="30">forgetting index</A>, <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning">subset learning</A>, <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">selective postpones</A>, <A title="Browser menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu">repetition sorting</A>, etc. These tools were poorly automated and required substantial effort and knowledge on your part. In practice, most incremental readers would have to opt for the simplest prioritization tool: <I>moderation</I>. You could best protect your previous investment in learning by limiting your hunger for knowledge. </P>
<P>Newer SuperMemos use a simple and fully automated mechanism that will help you combine high volumes of reading with high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="31">retention</A> of the most important material. This mechanism is based on the concept of the <B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="32">priority queue</A></B>.
