<P>Last week I went to the theatre.</P>
<P>I had a very good seat.<BR>The play was very interesting.</P>
<P>I did not enjoy it.<BR>A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.<BR>They were talking loudly.</P>
<P>I got very angry.<BR>I could not hear the actors.</P>
<P>I turned round.<BR>I looked at the man and the woman angrily.<BR>They did not pay any attention.<BR>In the end, I could not bear it.<BR>I turned round again.<BR>'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.</P>
<P>'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. </P>
<P>'This is a private conversation!'
