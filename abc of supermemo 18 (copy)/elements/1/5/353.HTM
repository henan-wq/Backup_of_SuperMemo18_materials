<strong><font color="blue">Priority queue : </font></strong>Prioritization is difficult before it becomes easy</SPAN></H2>
<P>Everyone struggles with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="81">priorities</A> as it is very hard to admit things are not as important as they seem. Of good things, there is a correlation between the hunger for knowledge and creativity. If you struggle with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="82">priorities</A> and overflow then it might be a good indicator, as long as you win the battle and learn to prioritize honestly. </P>
<P>To prioritize well, you only need to know that the most important material has <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="83">priority</A> <CODE>0%</CODE>, while your least important material is <CODE>100%</CODE>. You need to develop a sense for where, in the queue, a piece of information belongs. If you think that everything is "top priority" then you are clearly at the beginning of the road. Pick two <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="84">items</A> and ask yourself a question: <I>"If I was to forget/delete one, which one would that be?"</I> This exercise will help you see different applications of different <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="85">items</A> and different value behind the applications. Another exercise is: try to give <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="86">items</A> as low <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="87">priority</A> as you can stomach. Can you make it <I>10%</I>? Would you be hurt if it was <I>20%</I>? Would the world collapse if it was <I>66%</I>? With some conscious effort you will realize that you can live without some portions of your knowledge (after all, most people do not use SuperMemo at all and survive ok). Over months of training, you will get better at this. </P>
<P>If you keep peeking at the <A title=Statistics href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Statistics#Protection"><B>Protection</B> statistic</A>, you may also realize that sending <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="88">items</A> beyond your average priority protection will help you clear them from view for a while. This way, if you have created too many <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="89">cloze deletions</A> that crowd your process, you might actually enjoy sending most of them out of the protected zone, and focus on just one or two that capture the essence of knowledge you are trying to learn. </P>
<P>SuperMemo will not help you much in the prioritization work unless you manually play with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="90">intervals</A> (e.g. by saying "<I>this cannot wait 30 days, I must see it in 11</I>"). This tell SuperMemo that the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="91">priority</A> must increase slightly.
