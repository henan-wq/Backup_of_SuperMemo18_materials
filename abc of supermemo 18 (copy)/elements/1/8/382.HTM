<P><A title="Simple formula for high intelligence" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence">Human intelligence</A> is based on knowledge, of which <B><A title="Abstract knowledge" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge">abstract knowledge</A></B> plays a particularly important role. Abstract knowledge is based on rules, such as 2+2=4. Such rules may be employed in multiple contexts and contribute to problem solving capacity. Rules are more useful than facts. For example, it is more useful to know that 2+2=4 (rule) than to know that a friends's phone number beings with <I>4</I> (fact). Rules and formulas are more <A title=Applicability href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability">applicable</A> than facts.
