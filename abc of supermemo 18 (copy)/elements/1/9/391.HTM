<P><SPAN class=extract>This article describes the fastest avenue towards rock-solid lifetime knowledge: <B>Incremental Learning</B>.</SPAN> </P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>Incremental learning is the fastest and the most comprehensive way of learning available to students at the moment of writing (2013). </P>
<P></SPAN><SPAN class=extract>Incremental learning is a consolidation of computer-based techniques that accelerate and optimize the process of learning from all conceivable material available in electronic form, and not only. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Currently, <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo17.html">SuperMemo</A> is the only software that implements incremental learning.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>In SuperMemo, the student feeds the program with all forms of learning material and/or data (texts, pictures, videos, sounds, etc.).</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Those learning materials are then gradually converted into durable knowledge that can last a lifetime. </SPAN></P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning helps the student convert all forms of learning material into durable and lasting memories.</B> </P></DIV>
<P>In incremental learning, the student usually remembers 95% of his or her top priority material. That knowledge is relatively stable and lasts in student's memory as long as the process continues, and well beyond. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning easily ensures 95% recall of top-priority learning material for lifetime</B> (as long as the student ensures a regular review along the prescription provided by the program). </P></DIV>
<P>The cost of high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="0">knowledge retention</A> is very small when compared with various traditional learning methods. For example, in learning a language, the <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/english/ae.htm">vocabulary of an educated native speaker</A> can be retained in SuperMemo at the cost of 20 minutes per day in the first years of the process, and mere minutes in later years (assuming the original set is acquired in portions spread over 4 years in 30-50 min. sessions). </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning ensures high recall at a fraction of the cost in time (as compared to textbook learning).</B> </P></DIV>
<P>The incremental learning derives its name from the incremental nature of the learning process. In incremental learning, all facets of knowledge receive a regular treatment, and there is a regular inflow of new knowledge that builds upon the past knowledge. In incremental learning, the student sits in the driving seat and determines which knowledge should be mastered. He or she determines when this happens, with what degree of detail, at what <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1">priority</A>, and at what desired degree of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="2">recall/retention</A>. For example, in a single session, the student may learn a few facts of geography, discover a few rules of healthy lifestyle, figure out a few statistical formulas, read a couple of paragraphs from a friend's blog, process a few minutes of his home video collection, annotate a few family pictures, watch a few pieces from his YouTube video collection, and read a few articles in subjects related to a forthcoming exam. In other words, all areas of knowledge keep growing in parallel in proportion to interests and importance. </P>
<P>Typical learning at school puts an emphasis on a few areas of knowledge and neglects all the remaining areas. A medical student may spend a few months mastering anatomy, while gradually forgetting his biochemistry material in the meantime (or the other way round). At the same time, he or she will not find time to study important issues of the day that will always depend on a given person in a given context. With blinkers imposed by the heavy load of school material, the student may never find time, for example, to figure out what incremental learning is. Narrow horizons and narrow perspectives only make it harder to further rationalize the selection of the learning material. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>Incremental learning is the opposite of the irrational school system learning in which a heavy focus is put on just a few areas of knowledge in a semester (at the cost of other, equally important, areas of learning).</B> </P></DIV>
<H2><SPAN id=General_outline_of_incremental_learning class=mw-headline>General outline of incremental learning</SPAN></H2>
<P>In incremental learning, you acquire and maintain knowledge using the following steps: </P>
<UL>
<LI>importing knowledge from various electronic and non-electronic sources (e.g. articles on the web, YouTube videos, music files, pictures from your camera, e-mails, scanned paper notes, etc.) 
<LI><A href="#Priority_queue">prioritizing knowledge</A> for incremental processing (e.g. high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="3">priority</A> for physics, low <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="4">priority</A> for movie trivia, etc.). Incremental approach means processing knowledge in small bits and in small steps 
<LI>gradually converting the learning materials into lasting knowledge in your memory. This conversion may also produce an easily searchable and well-annotated computer media archive that does not even need to be part of the learning process 
<LI>expanding creatively upon the acquired knowledge (e.g. in the process of <A href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</A>, <A href="#Incremental_problem_solving">problem solving</A>, etc.)</LI></UL>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>With incremental learning, you can consolidate all sources of knowledge, and convert information into lifetime memories at the chosen cost in time, and along strictly defined goals and priorities.</B> </P></DIV>
<H2><SPAN id=Components_of_incremental_learning class=mw-headline>Components of incremental learning</SPAN></H2>
<P>Incremental learning tools differ substantially for various forms of learning material, media, and goals. Here are the main components of incremental learning: </P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> 
<LI><A href="#Visual_learning">incremental image learning</A> (or visual learning) 
<LI><A href="#Incremental_video">incremental video</A>

<LI>incremental creative elaboration (incl. <A href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</A>, <A href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</A>, etc.)</LI></UL>
<P>With the rich toolset offered by incremental learning, all reading, learning, viewing, archiving, and annotation functions can be delegated to SuperMemo. This goes far beyond standard learning and includes personal notes, home videos, lectures available in audio and video formats, YouTube material, family photo-albums, diaries, audio files, scanned paper materials, etc. </P>
<P>The oldest, most popular, and the most mature component of incremental learning is <B>incremental reading</B>. We will use incremental reading as the comprehensive introduction to other forms of incremental learning. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=The_value_of_interruption_in_learning class=mw-headline>The value of interruption in learning</SPAN></H2>
<P>In incremental learning, we often quickly move from one subject to another. Such interruptions may occur many times during a single learning day. When people first learn about this incremental methodology they immediately ask <I>"Why interrupt? Aren't these the prime principles of human endeavour to be thorough, persist, and do things right to the end?"</I> </P>
<P>The 3 main advantages of interruption in learning are: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>improving memory</B>: spaced learning has long been proven dramatically more efficient than conglomerate learning massed in time 
<LI><B>improving learning choices/priorities</B>: unless the learning material has been pre-selected by a higher authority, student's own choices require prioritization, which in turn requires preview. Previewing is a form of interruption. Regular interruption allows of prioritizing on the go 
<LI><B>improving attention</B>: whenever attention declines, change of the subject is the simplest remedy other than taking a definite break from learning</LI></UL>
<P>As for the disadvantages ... there are none! Simply put: <B>interruption is optional!</B> It is true that incremental learning may lead to "learning impatience" and "craving interruption", however, these have never been proven detrimental beyond showing that once you employ incremental learning, you may never want to go back to traditional "book at a time" learning. Nevertheless, you should not forget that schools are incremental too. Just on a slightly moderate scale. Schools employ interruption when kids move from geography to physics, or when they close the books for the day. </P>
<P>Once the art of incremental learning is mastered, the advantages go far beyond the advantages of the interruption or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="5">spaced repetition</A>. Here is a shortlist (for a detailed discussion see: <A href="#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</A>). </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>massive learning</B> - you learn more than you thought your memory can hold 
<LI><B>95% knowledge retention</B> - you nearly eliminate the problem of forgetting 
<LI><B>lifetime memories</B> - your memories will last for life (as long as you stick with the regular review schedule based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="6">spaced repetition</A>) 
<LI><B>comprehensive learning</B> on all fronts (rather than the school-like focus on 2-4 majors) 
<LI><B>better understanding</B> of the studied subject is assisted by moderation in consuming details, and easy inclusion of explanatory material (e.g. from dictionaries and/or encyclopedias) 
<LI><B>better consolidation of the knowledge structure</B> by incremental approach, interrupted learning, spacing, and slotting in of the new knowledge. Contrary to popular belief, incremental learning helps you keep the big picture in your mind 
<LI><B>better attention</B> by focusing on a single issue at a time without ever missing a detail, and by remedying attention deficits with a constant change of the learning material 
<LI><B>creativity</B> - by encountering different subjects in unpredictable sequences, your creativity soars. You can employ it, for example, in the process of <A href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</A> or <A href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</A> (this article was written using incremental writing tools in SuperMemo) 
<LI><B>battling chaos</B> - it is easier to resolve contradictions in SuperMemo, e.g. when processing new research with contradictory claims and findings. Unlike your memory in "real life" where you keep oscillating between contradictions, SuperMemo does not tolerate information discrepancy. Contradictory material converges up to a point when you realize you need to decide on the nature of the truth 
<LI><B>all knowledge is well prioritized</B> 
<LI><B>all knowledge is easily searchable</B> 
<LI><B>all knowledge is quantifiable</B> (size, retention, workload, etc.) 
<LI><B>stresslessness</B> - nothing frees your mind for learning efficiently as the sense that no detail will ever be missed and you can focus on a single problem at a time while delegating other problems to later 
<LI><B>fun</B> - once you master incremental learning, it can truly be the best part of your day with few other earthly pleasures giving you as much satisfaction as new useful knowledge</LI></UL>
<P>In short, with incremental learning you learn fast, you acquire massive loads of knowledge, retain memories for life, remember almost all that you have learned, understand things better, develop harmoniously in all directions, enhance your creativity, and all that while having incredible fun! If that sounds too good to be true, please read more below or just give it a solid try. For a detailed explanation see: <A href="#Advantages_of_incremental_learning">Advantages of incremental learning</A>. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Interruption_is_not_a_problem class=mw-headline>Interruption is not a problem</SPAN></H2>
<P>In learning, choosing the right learning sources is the first step to success. A well-written article will get you to the basic idea from its first paragraph or even a sentence. Incremental reading is best suited for articles written in hypertext or in an encyclopedic manner. Ideally, each sentence you read has a contribution to your knowledge and is not useless without the sentences that follow. </P>
<P>Imagine that you would like to learn a few things about <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</A>. You will, for example, import to SuperMemo an article about Nasser from <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>. In the first sentence you will find out that "<I>Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918 - 1970) was the second President of Egypt</I>". If you are new to Nasser, you may be happy to just know he was the Egyptian president and safely jump to reading other articles. Thus you may delay the encounter with the historic role of Nasser and economize some time to finding out, for example, who <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres">Shimon Peres</A> is. When you see the Nasser article for the second time, you might find that "<I>He was followed by after President Muhammad Naguib and can be considered one of the most important Arab leaders in history</I>". This piece of knowledge is also self-contained and you can patiently wait for your third encounter with Nasser. When you return the next time, you may conclude that another piece about Nasser is of lower priority: "<I>Nasser was born in Alexandria</I>". You can schedule the review of that piece in 2-3 years. Perhaps your interest in Nasser or in <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</A> will grow to the point that this knowledge will become relevant. If not, you can always <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Dismiss" oldtitle="Glossary:Dismiss" data-hasqtip="7">dismiss</A> or delete such an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="8">extract</A>. Alternatively, you can skip a few paragraphs and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="9">extract</A> a more important sentence: "<I>In 1952, Nasser led the military coup against King Farouk I of Egypt</I>". Even if your read individual sentences about Nasser in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="10">intervals</A> lasting months, your knowledge will progressively expand and will become increasingly consolidated (esp. if you employ <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="11">cloze deletions</A>, which are mandatory for longer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="12">intervals</A>). </P>
<P>Naturally, not all texts are are so well-suited for incremental reading. For example, a research paper may throw at you a detailed description of methods and leave results and conclusions for the end. In such cases, you may <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="13">extract</A> the abstract and delay the body of the paper by a period in which you believe the abstract will have been sufficiently processed. Then, if you are still interested in the article, you can schedule the methods well into the future (you will or will not read the methods depending on the conclusions of the article). You can schedule the results and the discussion into a less remote point in time, and proceed with reading the conclusions. </P>
<P>The hardest texts may not be suitable to reading in increments. For example, a piece of software code may need to be analyzed in its entirety before it reveals any useful meaning. In such cases, when the text (here the code) comes up in the incremental reading process, analyze it and verbalize your conclusions. The conclusions can then be processed incrementally. You will generate individual questions depending on which pieces of knowledge you consider important and which become volatile. The original computer code can be still retained in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="14">collection</A> as reference only. </P>
<P>When learning at the university, you do many courses in parallel. That's a macro version of incremental reading. Many people love to zap TV channels and play a chaotic version of <A title="Incremental video" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_video">incremental video</A> with their TV set. Zapping may not be a recommended way of learning, but it won't leave your mind blank. Another example can be seen in people who have a habit of reading a few novels in parallel. Their limit on the number of novels comes from the limits of human memory. There is a breaking point beyond which a novel, if read in bursts separated by longer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="15">intervals</A>, cannot be followed due to fading memories. Incremental reading is based on <A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</A>, and by definition is far less limited by your forgetful memory. The number of articles in the process can reach a hundred thousands, and given basic skills, you won't get confused. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Complexity_of_incremental_learning class=mw-headline>Complexity of incremental learning</SPAN></H2>
<P>Unlike classic SuperMemo, incremental learning requires quite a lot of experience and training before it becomes effective. However, your investment will be returned manifold once you become proficient with the method. </P>
<P>Incremental learning is a consolidation of technologies that have been in development for nearly 3 decades. It is still in the process of maturing and it is still pretty complex. It requires skills that take months to develop. It requires your own strategies that may mature over years. Moreover, incremental learning requires the mastery of SuperMemo, which has been optimized for professional use. As such it is not beginner friendly. </P>
<P>Users complain that SuperMemo has a steep learning curve. They are right. SuperMemo has been optimized to make a life of a pro easy. It makes life of beginners hard because it does not ever compromise the learning efficiency for sleekness or marketing value. Take the <A href="#Priority_queue">priority queue</A> as an example. Nearly everyone asks why the articles of highest value have a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="16">priority</A> of 0% rather than the obvious 100%. They ask: <I>"Why is SuperMemo always keeping things upside down?"</I>. They got a point. However, no pro user would ever swap the ease of typing 1, 2, 3 for his top priority material as opposed to 99, 98 or 97. Those dilemmas slow down the adoption of SuperMemo. However, once you become a pro, you will appreciate this approach and will more likely become a lifelong devotee. </P>
<H1><SPAN id=Incremental_reading class=mw-headline>Incremental reading</SPAN></H1>
<H2><SPAN id=Introduction_to_incremental_reading class=mw-headline>Introduction to incremental reading</SPAN></H2>
<P>Traditional linear reading is highly inefficient. This comes from the fact that various pieces of the text are of various importance. Some should be skipped. Others should be read in the first order of priority. Old-fashioned books are quickly being replaced with hypertext. Hypertext will help you quickly jump to information that is the most important at any given moment. Hypertext requires a different style of writing. All linear texts can assume that the reader is familiar with the preceding sections. This makes them context-poor. Within hypertext, individual texts become context-independent, and all difficult terms and concepts are explained primarily with additional hyperlinks. In the same way in which the web helped delinearize the global sources of information, SuperMemo can help you delinearize your reading of whatever linear material you decide to import to SuperMemo. While reading with SuperMemo, you will see a linear text as a sequence of sections subdivided into paragraphs and individual sentences. SuperMemo will help you provide a separate and independent processing for each section, paragraph or sentence. </P>

<P>Incremental reading is a learning technique that makes it possible to <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Can_you_really_read_thousands_of_articles_at_the_same_time?">read thousands of articles at the same time</A> without getting lost. Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall. The review process is handled by the proven <I><A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/english/ol/background.htm">spaced repetition algorithm</A></I> known as the <A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo"><B>SuperMemo method</B></A>. </P>

<LI><B>Output</B>: well-remembered knowledge (quizzed regularly in the form of questions and answers)</LI></UL></DIV>
<P>In incremental reading, you read articles in small portions. After you read a portion of one article, you go on to a portion of another article, etc. You introduce all important portions of texts into the learning process in SuperMemo. This way you do not worry that you forget the main thread of the article, even if you return to reading months later. Your progress with individual articles may be slow, but you greatly increase your efficiency by paying less attention to less important articles and spending more time on articles that are more beneficial to your knowledge. Difficult articles may wait until you read easier explanatory articles, etc. Last but not least, incremental reading increases your efficiency because it is fun! You never get bored. If you do not like an article, you read just a sentence and jump to other articles. This way your attention and focus stay maximized. </P>
<P><B>Warning!</B> Incremental reading may seem complex at first. However, once you master it, you will begin a learning process that will surpass your expectations.

<H5><SPAN id=Import_of_multiple_articles class=mw-headline>Import of multiple articles</SPAN></H5>
<P>The most convenient way to import learning materials to SuperMemo is a direct import of multiple articles right from the web. To import many articles at the same time, open these articles in Internet Explorer, and click the <B>Import</B> button on the <A title=Learnbar href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learnbar">learnbar</A> (or press <I>Ctrl+Shift+A</I>, or chose <B><A title="Edit menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Edit_menu">Edit</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Web import" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Web_import">Web import</A>&nbsp;: All</B> on the <A title="Main menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Main_menu">main menu</A>). To avoid importing advertising and other garbage, in Internet Explorer, select portions of the text that is to be imported. If you select texts before imports, you are less likely to need filters to get rid of troublesome HTML (available by pressing <I>F6</I> on the imported article). If you prefer to use other browsers, e.g. Chrome or Firefox, you will need to use <A href="#Import_by_Copy&amp;Paste">Copy&amp;Paste method</A>, or re-open the selected articles in Internet Explorer. This is because, at the moment, SuperMemo supports direct imports only from Internet Explorer. </P>

<H3><SPAN id=Skill_2:_Reading_articles class=mw-headline>Skill 2: Reading articles</SPAN></H3>
<P>Here is a simplified algorithm for reading articles: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Choose an article</B>: Import an article as <A href="#Skill_1:_Importing_articles">explained earlier</A> or bring up previously imported articles with <B><A title=Learn href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn">Learn</A></B> (<I>Ctrl+L</I>). <B><A title=Learn href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn">Learn</A></B> will display only articles imported in the past. If you import an article, and want to have it shown later during a learning session on the same day, you must place it in the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding queue" data-hasqtip="25">outstanding queue</A> (e.g. <B><A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Learning">Learning</A>&nbsp;: Later today</B> on the <A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu">element menu</A>, <I>Ctrl+Shift+J</I>, etc.). If you import many articles that you want to process on the same day, you must place them all in the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding queue" data-hasqtip="26">outstanding queue</A>. For example, open the articles in the <A title=Browser href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser">browser</A>, and choose <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Learning">Learning</A>&nbsp;: Add all to outstanding</B> (or use <B>Add to outstanding</B> icon on the <A title="Browser toolbar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_toolbar">browser toolbar</A>). Most of the time you can rely solely on <B><A title=Learn href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn">Learn</A></B> to schedule articles optimally for review. 
<LI><B>Click the article</B> to enter the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Editing_mode" oldtitle="Glossary:Editing mode" data-hasqtip="27">editing mode</A>, in which you can modify text, select fragments, etc. Optionally, use filter (<I>F6</I>), if the text is hard to process (e.g. selections are hard, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="28">extracts</A> not marked correctly, etc.) 
<LI><B>Start reading</B> the article from the top or from the last <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="29">read point</A> 
<LI><B>Extract texts</B>: If you encounter an interesting text in the article, select it and choose <B><A title=Learnbar href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learnbar#Extract">Remember extract</A></B> on the <A title=Learnbar href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learnbar">learnbar</A> (or press <I>Alt+X</I>). This operation will introduce the extracted fragment into the learning process as an independent mini-article. If you would like to specify the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="30">priority</A> of the new <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="31">extract</A>, choose <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reading">Reading</A>&nbsp;: Schedule extract</B> (<A title="Reading : Schedule extract, available on the Read toolbar, enables you to specify the priority of a text fragment being extracted" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Schedule_extract.png"><img alt="Reading : Schedule extract, available on the Read toolbar, enables you to specify the priority of a text fragment being extracted" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/f/fe/Schedule_extract.png" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) instead of <B>Remember extract</B>. Also, if you have an impression that the article is difficult and you would like to read some fragments later, extract those fragments with <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reading">Reading</A>&nbsp;: Schedule extract</B> and provide a review <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="32">interval</A> that will reflect the time you believe you will be better equipped to understand the extracted fragment. 
<LI>Optionally, use <B>Delete before cursor</B> (<I>Alt+\</I>). This will delete the text that you have read, clean up the article, remove garbage, and help tackle HTML that is difficult to process. 
<LI>Optionally, if you read a fragment that seems unimportant, select it (e.g. with the mouse) and either delete it (e.g. with the <I>Del</I> key) or mark it with the <SPAN class=ignore>ignore</SPAN> style. To mark a text as <SPAN class=ignore>ignore</SPAN>, choose <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reading">Reading</A>&nbsp;: Ignore</B> on the <A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">component menu</A>, click the <B>Ignore text</B> button (<A title="Reading : Ignore makes it possible for you to mark an unimportant fragment with the ignore style" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Ignore.png"><img alt="Reading : Ignore makes it possible for you to mark an unimportant fragment with the ignore style" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/7/75/Ignore.png" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title="Read toolbar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Read_toolbar"><B>Read</B> toolbar</A>, or just press <I>Ctrl+Shift+I</I>. 
<LI>Optionally, if the selected fragment does not include all the important reading context, you can add this context manually. For example, if you are learning history, you may extract the following fragment from an article about Lincoln: <I>On Sept. 22, 1862, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, one of the most important messages in the history of the world. He signed it Jan. 1, 1863.</I> If you would like to extract the fragment related to signing the Emancipation Proclamation, you will need to change <I>He</I> to <I>Lincoln</I> and <I>it</I> to <I>Emancipation Proclamation</I> so that your stand-alone fragment is understandable: <I>Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863.</I> You can use the <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reference">Reference</A></B> options on the <A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">component menu</A> to easily add context to your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="33">extracts</A> (see: <A href="#Adding_references">References</A>). Context added by <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reference">Reference</A></B> will be added automatically to all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="34">extracts</A> of a given article. For example, select the text that you want to serve as the reference title of all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="35">extracts</A> and choose <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reference">Reference</A>&nbsp;: Title</B> on the HTML <A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">component menu</A> (or press <I>Alt+T</I>). This text will appear at the bottom of all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="36">extracts</A> (in <SPAN class=reference>reference pink font</SPAN> by default). 
<LI>Optionally, mark your last <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="37">read point</A>: Once you decide to stop reading the article before its end, mark the last processed fragment as the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="38">read-point</A> (e.g. with <I>Ctrl+F7</I> or by choosing <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Reading">Reading</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#Read-points">Read-points</A>&nbsp;: Set read-point</B> from the HTML <A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">component menu</A>). Next time you come back to this same article, SuperMemo will highlight your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="39">read-point</A> and you will be able to resume reading from the point you last stopped reading the article. To go to your current <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="40">read point</A>, press <I>Alt+F7</I>. If you forget to set a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="41">read-point</A>, SuperMemo will leave a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="42">read-point</A> at the place of your last <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="43">extract</A> or last highlight. 
<LI><B>Go to the next article</B>: After you finish reading a portion of one article, choose <B><A title=Learn href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn">Learn</A></B> or <B>Next repetition</B> to proceed with reading other articles. Those buttons are located at the bottom of the <A title="Element window" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_window">element window</A>. You can also use <I>Enter</I>, which will work as long as the selection in the text is not empty (e.g. marked as a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="44">reading point</A>), or if you have left the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Editing_mode" oldtitle="Glossary:Editing mode" data-hasqtip="45">editing mode</A> (e.g. with <I>Esc</I>). If no text is selected, <I>Enter</I> will add a new line in the text (as is the case with standard text editors). 
<LI>Optionally, determine the next review date (e.g. with <I>Ctrl+Shift+R</I>), or set the new <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="46">priority</A> for the article (e.g. with <I>Alt+P</I>). 
<LI><B>In incremental reading, interrupted reading is a rule, not an exception!</B> With a dose of practice, you will quickly get accustomed to this not-so-natural state of affairs and learn to appreciate the power of the incremental approach. <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#The_value_of_interruption_in_learning">The main role of interruption is to prevent the decline in the quality of reading</A>. Use the following criteria to decide when to stop reading the article: 
<UL>
<LI><B>lack of time</B>: if you still have many articles for review for a given day and your time is running out, keep your increments shorter. After some time, being in a hurry will be a norm and you will tend to read only 1-2 paragraphs of each article and dig deeper only into groundbreaking articles that will powerfully affect your knowledge. 
<LI><B>boredom</B>: if the article tends to make you bored, stop reading. Your attention span is always limited. If your focus is poor, you will benefit more from the article if you return to it after some break. Go on to reading something that you are not yet tired of. If SuperMemo schedules the next review at a date you consider too late, use <I>Ctrl+J</I> or <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> to adjust the next review date. 
<LI><B>lack of understanding</B>: if you feel you need more knowledge before you are able to understand the article, postpone it (e.g. use <I>Ctrl+J</I> or <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> and schedule the next review in 100 days or so). If you believe you have already imported articles with relevant explanatory knowledge, you can search for these articles (e.g. with <I>Ctrl+F</I>). Once you find them, you can (1) execute a <A title="Subset review" class=mw-redirect href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_review">subset review</A>, or (2) add the articles to the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding queue" data-hasqtip="47">outstanding queue</A> for reading on the same day, or (3) advance the articles (for example, in the <A title=Browser href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser">browser</A>, you can execute: <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Learning">Learning</A>&nbsp;: Review all</B>, or <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Learning">Learning</A>&nbsp;: Add to outstanding</B>, or <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Advance">Advance</A>&nbsp;: Topics</B>). If you have not yet imported any explanatory articles, you can do it now (e.g. search the web and <A href="#Skill_1:_Importing_articles">import articles</A> as explained before). Note that you can select a piece of text in SuperMemo and use <I>Ctrl+F3</I> to search encyclopedias or dictionaries for more material on a given subject. 
<LI><B>lower priority</B>: read lower priority articles in smaller portions thus reducing the overall time allocation to low priority subjects. 
<LI><B>overload</B>: if you have a long queue of articles to read, you will naturally read in smaller portions</LI></UL>
<LI>Once you complete reading the entire article and have extracted all the interesting fragments, choose <B><A title=Learnbar href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learnbar#Done!">Done!</A></B> (<A title="Learning : Done will remove the article from the review process, and delete its contents (without deleting the extracted material" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Done!.png"><img alt="Learning : Done will remove the article from the review process, and delete its contents (without deleting the extracted material" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/0/01/Done%21.png" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title=Learnbar href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learnbar">learnbar</A>.

<P>SuperMemo will show you that extracting important fragments and reviewing them at later time will have an excellent impact on your ability to remember. However, it will also show that once the time between reviews increases beyond 200-300 days, reading and re-reading (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Passive_review" oldtitle="Glossary:Passive review" data-hasqtip="60">passive review</A>) will often result in insufficient recall. For this reason, sooner or later, you will need to convert your texts to specific questions. For that purpose you will use <B>cloze deletion</B>. </P>
<P>A cloze deletion is an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="61">item</A> that uses an ellipsis (<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>) to replace a part of a sentence. </P>

<LI><B>understandability</B>: <I>"the ARPA agency"</I> phrase may defy grammar rules you have learned in primary school, but it is by far more understandable than just <I>the ARPA</I>. In SuperMemo, understandability is more important than stiff rules of grammar or spelling!</LI></OL>

<UL>
<LI>the learning process will intermingle reading of new articles with reviewing your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="82">items</A> 
<LI>your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="83">items</A> will mostly have a form of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="84">cloze deletions</A>, i.e. sentences with a question posed by a missing part <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> (e.g. The planet nearest the Sun is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>) 
<LI>as the entire learning process is incremental, your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="85">cloze deletions</A> will often show up in an unfinished form</LI></UL>
<P>Incrementally processed articles will be subject to periodic review/reading. When you resume reading an article after a certain period, you will proceed to new sections, extracting newly acquired wisdom into separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="86">elements</A> with <I>Alt+X</I> (i.e. <B>Remember extract</B>). Usually, you will delete the remnants of the processed article with <B>Delete before cursor</B> (<I>Alt+\</I>). </P>
<P>The algorithms that determine the timing of (1) repetitions of question-and-answer material and (2) reviewing reading material are analogous but not identical. Most importantly, all repetitions and article presentations happen in increasing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="87">intervals</A> by default. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="88">incremental reading</A>, you will see a constant inflow of new articles into your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="89">collection</A>. Unprocessed material will need to compete with the newly imported material. Increasing review <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="90">intervals</A> make sure that your old material fades into lower priority if not processed early. The speed of processing will depend on the availability of your time and the value of the material itself. Articles that are boring, badly written, less important for your work or growth, will receive smaller portions of your attention and may go into long review <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="91">intervals</A> before you even manage to pass a fraction of the text. That is an inevitable side effect of a voluminous flow of new information into your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="92">collection</A> and into your memory. However, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="93">intervals</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="94">priorities</A> can easily be adjusted. If your priorities change, you can modify the way you process important articles. At review time, you can either read the entire article without interruption, or bring it back for review in a shorter <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="95">interval</A>. You can manually change its <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="96">priority</A> (e.g. with <I>Alt+P</I>). You can also use search tools (e.g. <I>Ctrl+F</I>) to locate more articles on the subject that you feel you have neglected. You can reprioritize a bunch of articles by changing their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="97">priority</A>. You can shorten <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="98">intervals</A> of articles, or review them all when needed (see: <A title="Subset review" class=mw-redirect href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_review">Subset review</A>). </P>
<P>The algorithm for reviewing questions and answers (e.g. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="99">cloze deletions</A>) is quite complex and limits your influence on the timing of repetitions (see: <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Algorithm">SuperMemo Algorithm</A>).

Each article receives a specific <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="103">priority</A>. The priority determines which articles are reviewed first and which can be postponed in case you run out of time. Each article is also assigned a number called the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="104">A-Factor</A> that determines how much <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="105">intervals</A> increase between subsequent reviews. For example, if <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="106">A-Factor</A> is 2, review <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="107">intervals</A> will double with each review. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="108">Priority</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="109">A-Factors</A> are set automatically, but you can change them manually at any time. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="110">Priorities</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="111">A-Factors</A> are determined and modified heuristically on the basis of the length of the text, the way it is processed, the way it is postponed or advanced, and by many other factors. You can change the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="112">priority</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="113">A-Factor</A> of an article by pressing <I>Alt+P</I>. You can also use <I>Shift+Ctrl+Up arrow</I> and <I>Shift+Ctrl+Down arrow</I> to increase or decrease an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="114">element</A>'s <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="115">priority</A>. Note that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="116">A-Factors</A> associated with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="117">items</A> cannot be changed by the user, as they are a reflection of item difficulty that determines the length of optimum inter-repetition <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="118">intervals</A> (see: <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index_in_SuperMemo">Forgetting index</A>). </P>
<P>You can control the timing of article review by manually adjusting inter-review <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="119">intervals</A>. Use <I>Ctrl+J</I> (<B>Reschedule</B>) or <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> (<B>Execute repetition</B>) to determine the date of the next review. <I>Ctrl+J</I> will increment the current <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="120">interval</A>, while <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> will first execute a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Repetition" data-hasqtip="121">repetition</A> and then set the new interval. For example, if your current <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="122">interval</A> is 100 and you specify the value of 3 in <B>Reschedule</B>, your new repetition date will be set in 3 days, and the last repetition date will not change (the new interval will be 103). If you do the same with <B>Execute repetition</B>, your new <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="123">interval</A> will be 3 and the last repetition date will be set to today. In other words, <B>Reschedule</B> increments the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="124">interval</A> (it can also shorten intervals), while <B>Execute repetition</B> sets the length of the interval (while leaving a trace of a repetition executed in the learning process). Note that <B>Reschedule</B> (<I>Ctrl+J</I>) executed at <B>Next repetition</B> stage will first complete the repetition and will have the same effect as <B>Execute repetition</B> (<I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I>). To delay a repetition during learning, use any of the earlier stages of the repetition cycle. </P>

<P>3 main principles will underlie the evolution of knowledge in SuperMemo: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>decrease in complexity</B> - articles will be converted into sets of paragraphs. Paragraphs will be dismantled into sets of independent sentences and statements. Sentences will be shortened to maximize the information-vs-wording ratio, etc. 
<LI><B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall" data-hasqtip="142">active recall</A></B> - all pieces of information will ultimately be converted into <B>active recall</B> material such as question-answer pairs, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="143">cloze deletions</A>, picture recognition tests, sound recognition tests, etc. This is to maximize your recall of knowledge 
<LI><B>incrementalism</B> - all changes will take place gradually in proportion to available time, with respect to your selected material's priority, and in line with the gradually increasing strength of memory traces. Incremental nature of learning in SuperMemo will help you get the maximum memory effect in minimum time. See: <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#The_value_of_interruption_in_learning">The value of interruption in learning</A></LI></UL>

<H4><SPAN id=Topics class=mw-headline>Topics</SPAN></H4>
<P>A topic in SuperMemo is an article, its part, or a sentence that you want to learn. Topics can also have a form of a picture, a video, a piece of music, etc. Unlike <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="154">items</A>, topics do not test your knowledge. They are used in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Passive_review" oldtitle="Glossary:Passive review" data-hasqtip="155">passive reading</A>, watching, or listening only. Short text topics are used to generate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="156">cloze deletions</A>.

<UL>
<LI>read the topic from the top 
<LI>if you find some interesting information, extract it (e.g. with <I>Alt+X</I>); the extract will form a new independent topic; the new topic will be shorter and will be handled in the same way as all other topics 
<LI>decide how far you want to go into reading the topic depending on its priority and available time (e.g. interrupt fast, if you are in a hurry, or read it all, if the topic is of top importance) 
<LI>if you finish reading the topic, execute <B>Done!</B> (e.g. <I>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</I>); this will delete the topic without deleting the material that it produced

<H4><SPAN id=Items class=mw-headline>Items</SPAN></H4>
<P>Item in SuperMemo is a piece of knowledge that you want to remember. It usually has a question&amp;answer form. The main difference between an item and a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="161">topic</A> is that an item actively tests your memory (e.g. with a question), while a topic is used for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Passive_review" oldtitle="Glossary:Passive review" data-hasqtip="162">passive review</A> only (e.g. for reading, viewing, watching, etc.). </P>
<H4><SPAN id=Concepts class=mw-headline>Concepts</SPAN></H4>
<P>SuperMemo 17 introduced a new element type: concept (denoted in <B><A title=Contents href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Contents">Contents</A></B> with an orange lightbulb icon (<A title="SuperMemo: A concept taking part in the learning process" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Concept_memorized.gif"><img alt="SuperMemo: A concept taking part in the learning process" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/f/f6/Concept_memorized.gif" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>)). Such an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="163">element</A> represents an important idea or subject.

It ensures you do not get overloaded, and it ensures that you minimize delays for top priority material.</LI></UL>
<P><B>Auto-postpone</B> always leaves a number of top-priority <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="192">elements</A> in the queue. The purpose of the postpone is to get rid of the main mass of low-priority material and focus on top-priority material. You are most likely to use <B><A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">Postpone</A></B> after a day of learning, while <B>Auto-postpone</B> is executed before your learning day begins. This is why it never affects today's material, and does not postpone top-priority material from previous days. If you have <B><A title="Learn menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn_menu#Postpone">Auto-postpone</A></B> checked on the menu, you will always start the day with all the repetitions scheduled for that day, and a number of unexecuted top-priority repetitions from previous days. Even though <B>Auto-postpone</B> increases the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="193">intervals</A> and reduces the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="194">retention</A> of low-priority material, it also makes you benefit from the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="195">spacing effect</A>. Research shows that longer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="196">intervals</A> may paradoxically increase the speed of learning (up to a certain point). This comes from the fact that the default <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="197">retention</A> in SuperMemo (around 95%) is higher than the retention that delivers the largest number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="198">items</A> remembered per unit of time invested. </P>
<P>You can start with default settings of the <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Sorting_repetitions">sorting criteria</A>, however, if you feel you make insufficient progress with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="199">items</A> (e.g. high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Forgetting_index" oldtitle="Glossary:Forgetting index" data-hasqtip="200">forgetting index</A>), you can reduce the proportion of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="201">topics</A>. If the inflow of new material is too slow, you can increase the proportion of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="202">topics</A>. If your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="203">priorities</A> are imperfect, increase the degree of randomization. If you think you miss too many high priority <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="204">items</A> (see: <B><A title="Toolkit menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Toolkit_menu">Toolkit</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Toolkit menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Toolkit_menu#Statistics">Statistics</A>&nbsp;: <A title=Analysis href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Analysis">Analysis</A>&nbsp;: <A title=Analysis href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Analysis#Use">Use</A>&nbsp;: Priority protection</B> from the <A title="Main menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Main_menu">main menu</A>), reduce the randomization. By trial and error, you will arrive at your optimum. Even after you find your optimum, keep experimenting with different randomization and topic levels.

<LI>Wikipedia has recently changed from PNG to MathML default in displaying mathematical formulas. To display formulas in SuperMemo, log in to Wikipedia, choose <B>Preferences&nbsp;: Appearance</B>, go to the <I>Math</I> section and choose <B>PNG</B>. Click <B>Save</B> to save the preferences. You will be able to illustrate your elements with PNG formulas and make them proliferate down the knowledge tree with extracts and clozes 
<LI>Instead of scanning paper books and doing OCR for the sake of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="227">incremental reading</A>, always begin with looking for electronic equivalents. In most basic areas of knowledge, there are multiple sources of learning materials available. There are fewer and fewer cases where you need to do any scanning. These days, you can even be finicky and search for HTML texts to replace your nice PDF materials (to avoid the pain of <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#PDF_to_HTML_converters">converting PDF to HTML</A>) 
<LI>Some texts rich in pictures and tables may be handled with difficulty by SuperMemo (the older the SuperMemo, the more difficulty you may experience). It may be very useful to learn to use HTML filters (press <I>F6</I>). Some of the problems stem from bugs in Internet Explorer that SuperMemo employs to display and edit texts formatted in HTML. This particularly refers to older versions of Internet Explorer (e.g. IE 6.0). It is therefore highly recommended you install Internet Explorer 7 or later to make your life easier 
<LI>If you are pressed by exam deadlines and still not too fluent with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="228">incremental reading</A>, it would make more sense to do some of your old and new learning in parallel. For example, 30% <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="229">incremental reading</A> and 70% traditional learning. You are bound to make many mistakes in strategy and the discovery process may take longer than until the exam. At the beginning you will have a big overhead cost (strategy, material selection, formulation, learning SuperMemo itself, etc.). It would not then be surprising if your performance on the exam actually dropped at your first try! You could pick a couple of chapters that you particularly enjoy and use them in your incremental learning practice. You would then process the rest of the material using your old methods. You cannot possibly embark on a massive conversion of textbooks into SuperMemo material before you get the feel of how to do it right! It can backfire and discourage the use of SuperMemo. As always, proceed carefully and incrementally</LI></UL>

<LI>SuperMemo uses 2 basic element types: <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="230">topics</A> (articles) and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="231">items</A> (questions and answers). Those are treated differently in the review process. <B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="232">Topics</A> represent what you want to know, while <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="233">items</A> hold what you know</B>. To better understand the difference, see: <A title="Items, topics, concepts, and tasks" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Items,_topics,_concepts,_and_tasks">Topics vs. Items</A> 
<LI>Keep your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="234">topics</A>/articles in check. Use your <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Sorting_criteria">sorting criteria</A> to make sure you get a solid dose of daily <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="235">items</A>/questions in addition to your reading. High topic overload may slow your item flow and damage the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall" data-hasqtip="236">active recall</A> process. <B>High topic load will make SuperMemo resemble traditional reading where your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="237">retention</A> is unacceptably low</B>. You can decide your optimum ratio on the basis of time needed for repetitions. For example, 5:1 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="238">item</A>:<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="239">topic</A> ratio would probably still make you spend more time on reading than on reviewing. Increase that ratio to increase your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="240">retention</A>, reduce the ratio temporarily if you need to do a great deal of reading. If you are not sure, set <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="241">items</A>:<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="242">topics</A> to anywhere between 3:1 and 8:1. Still too hard to decide? Review 5 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="243">items</A> for each <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="244">topic</A> in the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding queue" data-hasqtip="245">outstanding queue</A>.

<LI>In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="259">incremental reading</A>, you should always strive at converting passive texts into active questions. Ideally, all passive texts should be deleted when done with. All interference from "outside world" makes SuperMemo less precise. Passive texts provide little extra help in learning. At the same time, they provide interference, and should only be used to generate new <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="260">clozes</A> (or for reference)

You can see the newly created <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="263">item</A> by pressing <I>Alt+Left arrow</I>. Use that key to edit the newly created <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="264">cloze</A> (e.g. to add context clues, shorten the text, improve the wording, etc.). However, if possible, you should do such mini-jobs incrementally, i.e. on the next encounter with the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="265">clozed item</A> 
<LI>If you want to cloze more than one keyword, before you apply <B>Cloze</B>, you should make sure that the processed statement or paragraph is as simple as possible. You should try to <B>use only one-sentence <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="266">extracts</A></B> to generate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="267">cloze deletions</A>! Some newcomers dislike incremental learning at first. Monster <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="268">cloze deletions</A> are a chief reason for their negative feelings. Simplifying the parent paragraph to a simple statement will produce simple <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="269">clozes</A> that will require little processing. Using <B>Cloze</B> on complex texts multiplies the cost of re-editing when simplifying texts (in all cases where you cloze more than one keyword). If you use <B>Cloze</B> on a longer multi-sentence paragraph, you will have to put extra effort in simplifying the resulting <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="270">items</A>. All <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="271">cloze deletions</A> should be short enough to ensure you read them entirely at repetition time. Otherwise, your brain will tend to "deduce" the answer from non-semantic cues. This will defeat the purpose of learning! By using one-sentence <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="272">extracts</A> for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="273">cloze deletions</A>, you will save ages on repetition time and eons on time needed to simplify <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="274">clozes</A> and converting them to the final form based on the <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Minimum_information_principle">minimum information principle</A>. If you plan to cloze only a single keyword along the incremental principles, you can afford less pre-cloze simplification/editing, esp. on the material that still needs more work on its "big picture" structure 
<LI>Your work on extracting fragments, producing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="275">cloze deletions</A> and editing them should be incremental. <B>In each review, do only as much work on the learning material as is necessary!</B> Extracting and editing in intervals adds additional benefit to learning and is more time-efficient. Each time you rethink structure and formulation, you hone the representation and "connectivity" of a given piece of knowledge in your memory. In addition, your priorities change as you proceed with learning. At times, you will over-invest in a piece of knowledge that quickly becomes irrelevant or out-dated. The incremental approach will reduce the impact of over-investment. Incrementalism should then be used not only while reading, but also in the follow-up processing and formulation of knowledge. See: <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Examples:_Incremental_reading_in_action">Examples</A>. Unless you work with top-priority material, do not generate all your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="276">cloze deletions</A> in one go. Make it incremental. Generate a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="277">cloze</A> today, and another one at the next review. The incremental nature of the learning process, variegated coloring of texts marked with processing styles, and a complex extract hierarchy seem to quarrel with the perfectionist nature of many. However, the purpose of incremental reading is the maximum effect in minimum time. For that reason, at extract time, you are already forming passive trace memory engrams of the extracted sentence. The optimum strategy then is not to proceed with generating <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="278">cloze deletions</A>, but to move on to other <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="279">elements</A> in the queue or to other <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="280">extracts</A> in the same article (if the high priority of the article justifies it) 
<LI>Once you finish processing a paragraph with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="281">cloze deletions</A>, use <B>Done!</B> (<A title="Learning : Done will remove the article from the review process, and delete its contents (without deleting the extracted material" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Done!.png"><img alt="Learning : Done will remove the article from the review process, and delete its contents (without deleting the extracted material" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/0/01/Done%21.png" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title=Learnbar href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learnbar">learnbar</A> or on the <A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu">element menu</A> (e.g. with <I>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</I>).

A single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="289">cloze</A> generated from a short sentence often allows of retaining good memory of the entire statement for months.

<P>Some texts present knowledge in the form that is difficult to remember. Lists and sets are a good example of knowledge that does not stick to memory. Even if you perfectly know the map of Africa, answering the request: "<I>List all countries of Africa</I>" may be pretty hard. There are proven techniques that will help you tackle repetitive, list-rich, or boring knowledge with SuperMemo. All solutions are costly at memorization stage, but will pay handsomely in the long run due to lesser forgetting rate. The basic 2 principles are: </P>
<OL>
<LI>gradually glue individual pieces to your overall knowledge structure 
<LI>be as visual and mnemonic as possible</LI></OL>
<P>Here are some specific hints: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>use a mind map</B>: search the net for a nice mnemonic picture of the subject studied (e.g. political map of Africa). The picture will provide the basic skeleton for your memory. Like ornaments on a Christmas tree, you will hang new pieces of knowledge on this mnemonic skeleton. Use the picture to illustrate all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="300">topics</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="301">items</A> in the studied <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept_group" oldtitle="Glossary:Concept group" data-hasqtip="302">concept group</A>. 
<LI><B>do not learn it all at once</B>: Add individual <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="303">items</A> gradually at a point when they acquire some special meaning. Add them when they fit snugly with the rest of your knowledge. Add them when you specifically need them or when you learn about a related subject. If you need enumerative knowledge for an exam, cram it using traditional methods, and still continue adding individual pieces in unique contexts later on when you feel they are interesting or important. 
<LI><B>associate with stories</B>: if you ask an expert in the field, you will probably hear that (s)he mastered enumerative knowledge by association with individual case stories. Whatever he or she learned at school was quickly forgotten, but individual cases or problems to solve leave a good and durable imprint due to their uniqueness. Once you hit upon a story that is relevant to your hard-to-remember <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="304">items</A>, try to learn those items in the context of that particular story (e.g. hang the Cameroon up on your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Knowledge_tree" oldtitle="Glossary:Knowledge tree" data-hasqtip="305">knowledge tree</A> only when reading about <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Eto'o">Eto's</A> move to Chelsea). If you encounter cases in the course of your practise, describe them shortly and use them to supply context. 
<LI><B>supplement with incremental reading</B>: instead of formulating all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="306">items</A> along the same repetitive and monotonous template, try to use <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="307">incremental reading</A> to generate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="308">cloze deletions</A> that work on separate storylines. Ideally, you would review your topic and generate just a single subtopic (e.g. on a single country in Africa). Always choose the one that seems most obvious or most important to remember. Always try to add some supplementary material. Be sure you do not provide clues that will make you answer correctly without forming an appropriate association 
<LI><B>compare with experts</B>: ask an expert in the field how (s)he remembers a given fact or association. In some cases you may be dismayed to see how poorly experts recall compulsory college material. At other times, you will see how their memory tackles the problem with ease by using a simple mnemonic. This will help you emulate real life learning at a compressed timescale without ever wasting time on trying to master what others never manage to master anyway. That's the basic difference between school learning and your efficient incremental learning: you do not cram it dry along a rigid prescription. You use your creativity to incrementally build a durable structure of useful knowledge!</LI></UL>

<P>If you happen to learn the geological periods, you are bound to generate nasty <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Leech" oldtitle="Glossary:Leech" data-hasqtip="309">leeches</A>, esp. if you are new to the subject. Using the top-down learning rule, be sure you know the eras, before you learn the periods, and before you move on to the epochs, and further down the tree of knowledge. </P>
<P>A typical mistake would be to start from cramming the meaningless sequence of periods. For example, clozing the Paleozoic Era sequence: "<I>Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian</I>" could result in a question that is bound to cause problems: "<I>Cambrian, Ordovician, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian</I>". This <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="310">cloze</A> will trouble anyone who is not privy to the field. In other words, only those who come with the knowledge ready in their mind will be able to tackle this type of question at little cost! <B>Conclusion: there is no point in learning lists the hard way unless you already know what you are trying to learn!</B> Catch 22! </P>
<P>Instead of using the above approach, it would make far more sense to first anchor the Silurian period in your mind with some meaningful event. For example, the appearance of the bony fish. This way, we might start with a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="311">cloze</A> based on "<I>The bony fish appeared in Silurian (443-419 mn years ago)</I>". The following question will be far easier to remember: "<I>The bony fish appeared in <SPAN class=cloze>[...](period)</SPAN>(443-419 mn years ago)</I>". Even if the answer is the same as in the original unfortunate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="312">cloze</A>, that question is not semantically equivalent. You will need more <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="313">cloze deletions</A>. However, working with similar sequences should always proceed incrementally and in proportion to anchoring individual periods in memory. Later on you can move on to clozing dates, epochs, and other details. All the time you should try to add new interesting anchors and work with the material in parallel to the inflow of meaningful information that is likely to stay long in memory. </P>

<LI>The optimum time allocation for reading (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="319">topics</A>) and learning (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="320">items</A>) depends on a number of factors: the subject and the importance of articles, their difficulty, fun factor, your interests, your preferences, your knowledge, your mood, your circadian cycle, etc. <B>The optimum allocation of time can vary from seconds to hours!</B> This is one of the factors where the power of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="321">incremental reading</A> comes from. For some texts, you may find it difficult to reach reasonable attention levels for longer than a few minutes. Often you can retain your maximum processing power for just a single sentence or paragraph. On other texts that are highly interesting, well written, highly useful, or highly important, your curiosity and rage to master may kick in and let you go on for several hours without a break. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="322">incremental reading</A>, the primary criterion for time allocation is your level of concentration. You can literally lick a hundred articles in a continuous block of time and still keep your mind highly focused and alert. Some articles will be processed in depth, others will be quickly postponed. The concentration criterion is all-inclusive. It includes all factors listed above: difficulty of an article may affect your concentration, your tiredness will always reduce optimum allocations for difficult texts and increase allocations for interesting or enjoyable texts (those who help you "survive" a bad learning day) 
<LI><B>You can leave some low-priority material in the passive form</B> (i.e. without generating <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="323">cloze deletions</A>). Naturally, this material will gradually become difficult to recall or entirely forgotten. The best moment for using <B>Remember cloze</B> is when you notice that the material becomes volatile. Do not convert the entire passage into <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="324">clozes</A> at once (unless it is very important). Pick the most important keyword and create just a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="325">cloze deletion</A>. When the next review of the passage comes along, you will be able to determine which other keywords must be used with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="326">cloze deletion</A> to prevent forgetting the key information. It is very difficult to predict how many <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="327">clozes</A> you will need to generate to attain perfect recall of the whole passage. On occasion, a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="328">cloze</A> suffices. At other times, a single passage can require a dozen of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="329">clozes</A>! 
<LI><B>The better you get, the more often you will want to resort to incremental learning</B>. The stronger your incremental learning skills, the shorter the working period that makes employing incremental learning effective. For a proficient user, even a next day's assignment might make sense to be done with incremental learning tools. For a beginner though, it is enough to consider that it may take you a few months of practise to truly understand the flow of knowledge in incremental reading (and in your memory). This alone might make it ineffective in learning for a test that comes in a month or two 
<LI><B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-postpone" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-postpone" data-hasqtip="330">Auto-postpone</A></B> brings you closer to the ideal spaced repetition learning by reducing the load of low priority material that you cannot possibly master due to excess volume. In a sense, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-postpone" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-postpone" data-hasqtip="331">auto-postpone</A> separates high priority material (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="332">spaced repetition</A>) and low priority material (traditional learning).

<LI><B>Derivation steps in reasoning/mathematics</B>. If you are learning mathematics, you might wonder if you should commit individual derivation steps of a mathematic proof or solution, or should you just focus on the final outcome. The choice will depend on your goals. If you only need the final formula, time spent on learning the derivation steps could be better spent learning other important portions of the material. If you are not sure today what you will need in the future, you could just type in the whole derivation into a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="352">topic</A> and memorize the final formula. Later, in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="353">incremental reading</A>, you will make incremental decisions whether portions of the derivation are or are not important in your work or further learning. This piece of knowledge will compete with others in the learning process and in the long term you may ultimately decide if you want to memorize the details, keep them for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Passive_review" oldtitle="Glossary:Passive review" data-hasqtip="354">passive review</A> only, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Dismiss" oldtitle="Glossary:Dismiss" data-hasqtip="355">dismiss</A>/delete some of the steps, or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Dismiss" oldtitle="Glossary:Dismiss" data-hasqtip="356">dismiss</A> the entire derivation as redundant (or too costly to learn). Naturally, derivation will often enhance your ability to efficiently use the formula. Hence the decision is never easy. Once you have derivation steps committed, you can always play with their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="357">priority</A> to determine the probability you will review them well enough to make a difference to your knowledge. 
<LI><B>You can separate reading (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="358">topic</A>) from review (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="359">items</A>)</B>. However, variety is a spice of life. A random mix of reading and repetitions is a very powerful tool in overcoming the monotony of the earlier versions of SuperMemo. Interspersing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="360">topics</A> with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="361">items</A> provides for many of the advantages of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="362">incremental reading</A> as opposed to traditional learning or classical SuperMemo. To review <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="363">topics</A> only (reading) choose (1) <B><A title="View menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/View_menu">View</A>&nbsp;: <A title="View menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/View_menu#Outstanding">Outstanding</A></B>, (2) <B><A title="Browser menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu#Child">Child</A>&nbsp;: Topics</B> and then (3) <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations">Process browser&gt;</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Learning">Learning</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning">Learn</A></B> (<I>Ctrl+L</I>). To make repetitions only (<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="364">items</A>), use an analogous method. It might be a better strategy to mix <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="365">topics</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="366">items</A> during the reading phase, and consolidate knowledge by making item-only repetitions later in the day. In the end, sticking to <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="367">priorities</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-sort" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-sort" data-hasqtip="368">auto-sort</A>, and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-postpone" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-postpone" data-hasqtip="369">auto-postpone</A> will be the best least-biased long-term strategy 
<LI><B>Fun is the key to success</B>: If your learning text is too "dry", not too meaningful, too wordy, etc. the fun of learning will drop. If learning is not enjoyable, it is less likely to be effective. If you dislike a specific article, perhaps a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia replacement</A> would be fun and more meaningful? Even if this is a bit longer, you can process it pretty fast with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="370">incremental reading</A>, illustrate with pictures, and enjoy the process 
<LI><B>Nurse your hunger for knowledge</B>: You have to find the clear-cut link between knowledge and the value it brings to life. The hunger for knowledge grows as you get more educated (the more you know the more you know you don't know). So there is an excellent remedy for poor motivation: learn more and see how it can impact your and others' life

You can determine the level of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="375">retention</A> for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="376">items</A> (e.g. with the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Forgetting_index" oldtitle="Glossary:Forgetting index" data-hasqtip="377">forgetting index</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="378">priorities</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-postpone" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-postpone" data-hasqtip="379">auto-postpone</A>, etc.). You can execute forced ahead-of-time review of any material (see: <A title="Subset review" class=mw-redirect href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_review">Subset review</A>) 
<LI><B>You MUST NOT memorize material that you do not understand!</B> There is some hope that by doing more learning in other areas you will at some point understand. It is far more likely though that you will build up frustration with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="380">items</A> that mean little. If you do not understand a term or concept, you need to dig deep into why. Is it terminology? This can be easily investigated and fixed. Or is it a problem with the material itself? Perhaps you can find an alternative on the net? Perhaps you can find a nice picture on the net to illustrate the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="381">item</A>? Obviously, each little investigation takes time, but it is better to master 10-20% of the material well, that to cram an encyclopedia without comprehension. Even if you fail an exam, those 10% can be useful in the future (e.g. if you retake the exam). In general, schools load more than students can master and this leads to lots of stress and frustration. By choosing SuperMemo, you have already made the first good step. Now you need to make order in the process and think carefully about your best long-term strategy. Comprehension is the key to success!

<UL>
<LI>recognition is good for your exam, but recall is vital for your professional skills in the long-term 
<LI>manually organizing the timing of review is not what suits your memory best; it is actually quite the opposite to the idea of SuperMemo, which says that you review the material at moments that help stabilize memories 
<LI>manually organizing the order of review is not what suits your memory best (even though <A title="Subset review" class=mw-redirect href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_review">subset review</A> is a very useful tool in SuperMemo when preparing for an exam) 
<LI>for beginners, traditional learning might be superior to SuperMemo in a very short-term (perhaps up to 1-2 months) because of the steep learning curve. You need to learn the toolset of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="420">incremental reading</A> before you can reap the benefits (unless you employ simple Q&amp;A learning when SuperMemo might be superior even within a week's perspective) 
<LI>you may reach 95% recall within 1-2 weeks on condition that you do not <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">postpone</A> your review. However, if you dump 1,000 pages of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="421">topics</A> into the process at once, you will simply not manage to review all that material as scheduled by SuperMemo, and your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="422">retention</A> might hover around 60-80% depending on how much time you invested in making repetitions 
<LI>once SuperMemo learns a bit about your memory and habits (1-3 weeks), you will oscillate around 95% recall as of the first repetition (if you do not <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">delay</A>, and if you stick to the <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">rules of formulating knowledge</A>) 
<LI>you will quickly discover that multiple <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="423">cloze deletions</A> on a single paragraph are not a good idea (e.g. compare the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Measured_forgetting_index" oldtitle="Glossary:Measured forgetting index" data-hasqtip="424">measured forgetting index</A> with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="425">items</A> that have the same cloze keywords separated, or just see how thus gained knowledge works in practice)

<P>Incremental learning offers a possibility of studying a huge number of subjects in parallel. In traditional reading, very often, one book or academic subject must be completed before studying another.

<P>As incremental learning is based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="426">spaced repetition</A>, all memories that you form while learning will be indefinitely protected from forgetting.

Incremental reading requires continual <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="428">retention</A> of knowledge. Depending on the volume of knowledge flow in the program, the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="429">interval</A> between reading individual portions of the same article may extend from days to months and even years. <B>SuperMemo (<A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/english/ol/background.htm">repetition spacing</A>) provides the foundation of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="430">incremental reading</A>, which is based on stable memory traces that would not fade between the bursts of reading</B> </P>

<P>In incremental learning, the review of the learning material is governed by a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Computational_spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Computational spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="431">spaced repetition algorithm</A> known as the SuperMemo method. The algorithm ensures 95% knowledge <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="432">retention</A> by default. That fraction can be increased at the cost of higher cost in time (i.e. more frequent review). <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="433">Retention</A> can also be reduced to increase the overall speed of learning. In heavily overloaded <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="434">collections</A>, 95% retention figure refers only to top-priority material.

<P>One of the limiting factors in acquiring new knowledge is the barrier of understanding. Building knowledge in your brain is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces cannot be placed in the puzzle before the others. Some pieces capitalize on others. There is no point in memorizing facts about <I>Higgs boson</I> before you learn what the <I>standard model</I> is and that, in turn, should follow the general understanding of <I>particle physics</I> which itself requires some <I>ABC of physics</I>. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="436">incremental reading</A>, if you encounter texts related to <I>Higgs boson</I> you can manually delay it until the time you hope your <I>Physics ABC</I> will provide the ground for understanding the boson. In traditional reading, you would just waste your time on reviewing <I>Higgs boson</I> material just because you would not have tools to effectively reschedule and reprioritize your reading in the middle of a longer article. Traditionally, your decision to skip the material would provide no definite way of coming back to the skipped material in the future. With <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="437">incremental reading</A>, you waste no time on reading material you do not understand. You can safely skip portions of material and return to them in the future. You become the master of the conscious knowledge building process. You can gradually build understanding of complex phenomena. </P>
<P>All written materials, depending on the reader's knowledge, pose a degree of difficulty in accurately interpreting their meaning. This is particularly visible in highly specialist scientific papers that use a sophisticated symbol-rich language. A symbol-rich language is a language that gains conciseness by the use of highly specialist vocabulary and notational conventions. For an average reader, symbol-rich language may exponentially raise the bar of lexical competence (i.e. knowledge of vocabulary required to gain understanding). <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="438">Incremental reading</A> makes it possible to delay the processing of those articles, paragraphs or sentences that require prior knowledge of concepts that are not known at the moment of reading. The processing of the learning material will only take place then when the new information begins to slot in comfortably in the fabric of the reader's knowledge. You can then gradually proceed through this material and gradually build the understanding from basic or simple facts towards details or more complex components of knowledge. You will build understanding, resolve contradictions and ultimately creatively discover new truths about the learned material. Over time, you will optimize the structure of knowledge in your mind in terms of coherence, integrity, and representation. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="439">Incremental reading</A> will make it possible to tackle the hardest material that might otherwise seem unreadable. </P>

<P>Instead of focusing on a single subject of study, the student will review dozens of subject areas in a single day.

The growth of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Knowledge_tree" oldtitle="Glossary:Knowledge tree" data-hasqtip="440">knowledge tree</A> will also be guided by the present level of understanding of individual subjects, in proportion to the growth of the supporting knowledge and specialist terminology. Instead of growing a few thick <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Branch" oldtitle="Glossary:Branch" data-hasqtip="441">branches</A>, the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Knowledge_tree" oldtitle="Glossary:Knowledge tree" data-hasqtip="442">knowledge tree</A> will grow twigs in all possible directions while still adding bulk to the trunk and main boughs. Incremental learning is inherently incapable of producing medical experts who have never heard of the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">Kuiper Belt</A>, or astronomers who have no idea what constitutes a basic healthy diet.

<P>The key to creativity is an association of remote ideas. By studying multiple subjects in unpredictable order, you will increase your power to associate ideas. This will immensely improve your creativity. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="443">Incremental reading</A> may be compared to brainstorming with yourself.

In the long run, the greatest creative advantage comes from knowledge permanently stored in your memory (as opposed to knowledge that requires <A class="external text" href="http://google.com">Google</A>). It is only a matter of creative effort and invested time before different pieces of knowledge can be associated to form new quality.

This process is called <A title="Creativity and problem solving in SuperMemo" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_brainstorming">incremental brainstorming</A>. <A title="Creativity and problem solving in SuperMemo" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_brainstorming">Incremental brainstorming</A> is slower, but it does not need synchronization (circadian rhythm, time zones, motivation, etc.), and you do not need to interrupt each other's work. <A title="Creativity and problem solving in SuperMemo" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_brainstorming">Incremental brainstorming</A> will never replace face-to-face interactive collaboration, however, it has many advantages associated with incremental learning (creativity, <A href="#Prioritization">prioritization</A>, <A href="#Attention">attention</A>, <A href="#Meticulousness">meticulousness</A>, long-term viability, etc.). It may provide an excellent knowledge-based supplement, or be your best creative collaboration tool when working at a distance (esp. via different time zones).

<P>Contradiction and chaos in your learning material comes from bad sources, from errors, from disagreements in science, or from the fact that you start the process from importing a set of unrelated or even chaotic articles describing a studied complex problem. </P>
<P>If your learning material contains contradictory information, your brain will quickly alert you to this fact. In classical learning, you would often relearn new facts that would contradict earlier learned facts. Then you would relearn the older version again and this wasteful cycle might repeat more than once. In SuperMemo, the same process can take place; however, there will be two mechanisms that will turn chaos and contradiction into a self-limiting condition. The first mechanism relies on <B>high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="444">retention</A> of knowledge</B> in SuperMemo that will often make you instantaneously spot the contradiction: <I>Wait a minute! I have already learned this fact and the answer was different!</I> Unfortunately, even SuperMemo isn't hermetic to contradiction (your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="445">retention</A> actually never reaches 100%). The second mechanism is the <B>convergence of contradictory material</B> in time. If you, for example, learn two different answers to <I>What is the size of human population?</I>, say, <I>5.5 billion</I> and <I>6 billion</I>, you will naturally provide a wrong answer to one of these questions. Once you relearn it the new way, you will provide a wrong answer to the other question. Inter-repetition <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="446">intervals</A> for these two contradictory <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="447">items</A> will get shorter with each relearning cycle. The repetitions of contradictory <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="448">items</A> converge in time. Sooner or later, the red alert will be raised by your brain. You will quickly resolve the difference and delete one of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="449">items</A>. Similar process will affect hazy or incompletely specified information. Your knowledge will grow in consistency with time. </P>
<P>In scientific research, acquiring engineering knowledge, studying a narrow topic of interest, etc. we are constantly faced with a chaos of disparate and often contradictory statements. By introducing the chaos of new research into SuperMemo, you will gradually locate contradictions and strive at building better and more consistent models in your memory. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="450">Incremental reading</A> <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=stochastic">stochastically</A> <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=juxtapose">juxtaposes</A> pieces of information coming from various sources and uses the associative qualities of human memory to emphasize and then resolve contradiction. You will quickly lean towards theories that are better supported by research findings. Those supported poorly will be less firm and will often cause recall problems. Naturally, it may happen that you wish to learn contradictory statements too. For example, the opinions of dissenting scientists. In those cases, SuperMemo will help you emphasize the need of rich context. You will label individual statements with their proponent names or with the school of thought labels. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Stresslessness class=mw-headline>Stresslessness</SPAN></H3>
<P>Observers and new users of SuperMemo believe that complexity of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="451">incremental reading</A> must make it stressful. Some report that <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#SuperMemo_user's_opinion:_Why_I_do_not_use_incremental_reading?">even reading about incremental learning is stressful</A>. However, even though complexity always leads to a degree of stress or confusion, in the long-term, the opposite is true: SuperMemo helps you combat stress. Stressless learning is one of the greatest advantages of incremental learning. All the advantages listed in this section contribute to the sense of fun and relaxation. However, SuperMemo's ability to combat information overload might be the chief factor. Conversely, low stress levels have a miraculous impact on the effectiveness of learning. </P>
<P>Not everyone is stressed with information overload. There is a precondition for experiencing stress of having too much to read or too much to learn: obsessive hunger for knowledge, fear of not being able to keep up, pressing need for new knowledge, etc. This precondition is met in a great proportion of the general population according to a number of studies, and is actually less likely in younger individuals, including students, who are shielded from stress by their less crystallized motivation for learning. </P>
<P>The term <I>Information Fatigue Syndrome</I> has been coined recently to refer to stress coming from problems with managing overwhelming information. Some consequences of IFS listed by Dr. David Lewis, a British psychologist, include: anxiety, tension, procrastination, time-wasting, loss of job satisfaction, self-doubt, psychosomatic stress, breakdown of relationships, reduced analytical capacity, etc. The information era tends to overwhelm us with the amount of information we feel compelled to process. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="452">Incremental reading</A> does not require all-or-nothing choices on articles to read. All-or-nothing choices are stressful! <I>Can I afford to skip this article? For months I haven't had time to read this article!</I> etc. SuperMemo helps you prioritize and skip articles partially (by decision) or automatically (i.e. behind the scenes). Oftentimes, reading 3% of an article may provide 50% of its reading value. Reading of articles may be delayed without your participation, i.e. not by stressful procrastination, but by a sheer competition with other pieces of information on the basis of their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="453">priority</A>. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="454">incremental reading</A>, instead of hesitating or procrastinating, you simply prioritize. </P>
<P>If you happen to open a dozen of tabs in your web browser, you will often be stressed about the optimum course of action. You might be late for sleep, or late for work, and yet you do not want to lose the information. In SuperMemo, you just <A href="#Skill_1:_Importing_articles">import</A>&amp;prioritize. Or just <A href="#Skill_1:_Importing_articles">import</A>. Nothing is lost. You will encounter the imported material as soon as your learning time allocations permit. Similarly, you can clear your 1,000 pieces mail Inbox in a few hours with all pieces of mail well prioritized and scheduled for review. </P>
<P>Once you know you can rely on SuperMemo in presenting review material for you, you can eliminate the stress and anxiety related to having too much to study or too much to read. You will never manage to read or learn all that you would hope for, but you will at least not lose sleep over planning and scheduling. SuperMemo is a promise of the best use of your potential. With this conviction, you can devote all your energy to comprehension, analysis and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="455">retention</A> of the learned material. </P>
<P>SuperMemo helps you take away a big deal of information overload stress. In a typical IFS stress therapy, you will see that scrupulous notes, ordering one's desk, planning one's work, keeping a calendar of appointments, etc. all have a strong therapeutic value. SuperMemo does exactly the same: it helps you keep a scrupulous and well-prioritized record of what you want to read and takes away stressful chaos from the process of acquiring information and learning the collected material. SuperMemo eliminates disorder and the ensuing uncertainty that often characterizes wild searches for information on the net. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Attention class=mw-headline>Attention</SPAN></H3>
<P>Human brain has an in-built limit on the attention span. We all get bored with things. This is particularly visible in kids. Limited attention helps maximize the learning input. This is why most toys have a short lifespan, and other kids' toys seem always more interesting. The same is true of reading. Even the best articles can become taxing if they get too long. Millions of people do a daily channel zapping on TV. This absurd activity is driven precisely by the craving for dense action and information variety. A gripping movie goes "too slow" for a typical channel zapper. This is why he or she prefers to watch three movies at the same time (even though the coherence of the plot of each will suffer). Incremental learning is a perfect remedy to the limited attention span. Even a single unlucky paragraph in an article may greatly reduce your enthusiasm for reading. If you stumble against a few frustrating paragraphs, you may gradually develop a dislike of reading a particular article. You may even become fed up with reading for the entire evening. </P>
<P>In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="456">incremental reading</A>, once you sense any sign of boredom or distraction, you can jump to the next article with mostly positive side effects (expressed mainly in better memories produced by spaced learning). Unlike in channel zapping, you won't miss any information. Just the opposite, you will maximize attention per paragraph. Your attention to the same piece of information may depend on your mood, amount of prior reading, today's interest that may depend on the piece of news you heard on the morning radio, etc. With <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="457">incremental reading</A>, you can fit your best attention to each individual piece of reading. You can change the approach depending on your circadian status (i.e. the time of the day, mental energy, etc.). You can deprioritize articles that undermine attention. You can split intimidating articles into more manageable portions. The boost in attention is one of the main reasons why <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="458">incremental reading</A> is more fun than ordinary reading. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Consolidation class=mw-headline>Consolidation</SPAN></H3>
<P>Everything we learn must be reviewed from time to time in order to be remembered. If you read an article in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="459">intervals</A>, you already begin the consolidation of memory which may save you lots of time. In traditional reading, you would need to read the whole article, and then to review the article later several times. With earlier releases of SuperMemo, you would need to read the whole article, and then only review the most important parts of the article in SuperMemo at <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="460">intervals</A> determined by the program. Now you can begin the consolidation-review cycle already during reading! <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="461">Incremental reading</A> combines the process of extracting pieces of valuable knowledge with memory consolidation. This pre-consolidation will often dramatically reduce the number of repetitions required before your material gets to be reviewed in long <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="462">intervals</A> of months and years. By the time you convert parts of the material into <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="463">clozes</A> or question-answer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="464">items</A>, you will already have it well-consolidated. This consolidation will be based on solid context, a degree of redundancy (that helps <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="465">retention</A>), and an easy-to-remember formulation based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="466">cloze deletion</A>.

This slow process of jelling out knowledge produces an enhanced sense of meaning and applicability of individual pieces of information. Semantically equivalent pieces of information may be consolidated in varying contexts adding additional angles to their associative power. In other words, not only will you remember better. You will also be able to view the same information from different perspectives. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Prioritization class=mw-headline>Prioritization</SPAN></H3>
<P>You always have a long queue of articles to read, and there are always more articles to read than you can ever hope to remember. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="468">incremental reading</A>, you can precisely determine the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="469">priority</A> of each article, paragraph, sentence or question. Evaluating articles and prioritizing them is difficult because you cannot do a good evaluation without actually reading a part of the article in question. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="470">incremental reading</A>, you can read the introduction and then decide when to read the rest. If an article is extremely valuable or interesting, you can process it entirely at once. Other articles can slowly scramble through the learning process. Yet others may ultimately be deleted. The prioritization will continue while you are reading the article. If the evaluation of quality or content changes while reading, so will the reading-review schedule. </P>
<P>Prioritization tools will ensure that important pieces of information will receive better processing. This will maximize the value of your reading time. This will also reduce the impact of material overflow on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="471">retention</A>. You will always remember the desired proportion of your top-priority material.

You can modify it manually while reading in proportion to the value you extract from a given article. The <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="473">priority</A> will also change automatically each time you generate article <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="474">extracts</A>. It will change if you delay or advance scheduled reading.

<H3><SPAN id=Speed_.28of_reading.29></SPAN><SPAN id=Speed_(of_reading) class=mw-headline>Speed (of reading)</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental readers can beat speed readers in the speed of reading! This is true even for relative beginners with little or no speed-reading training. The caveat: all that is possible at the cost of delayed comprehension. In speed-reading, you always need to worry about the comprehension level. High comprehension is where speed-reading skills are vital. However, in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="481">incremental reading</A>, you can quickly skim through less important portions of the text without worrying you will miss a detail. The skimmed fragment will be scheduled for later review. You can optionally determine when the review will happen and at what <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="482">priority</A> (low priority review may be delayed further, often automatically). You can quickly jump from paragraph to paragraph, get the overall picture, mark fragments for later reading, mark fragments for detailed study, etc. This speed-reading method, with a bit of training, is stress free. You will eliminate the greatest bottleneck of speed-reading: fear of missing important pieces of information. When you come back to the skimmed fragments in the future, they may have already become irrelevant or less important. That is one of a savings in time generated by <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="483">incremental reading</A>. You always focus on top priority material and you spend little time worrying about things that are left for later reading. <B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="484">Incremental reading</A> is speed-reading without the loss of comprehension</B>. Once you speed-read the entire article, you can slowly digest it again from the very beginning in the incremental reading process. Needless to say, speed-reading does not come close to <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="485">incremental reading</A> when it comes to long-term <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="486">retention</A>. Memories are always subject to forgetting. All valuable information that you collect while reading may be forgotten at any time. Pieces that would be retained without SuperMemo (e.g. through regular use) produce minimum workload. Other pieces will allow you to never need to come back to the article in question. In conclusion, all knowledge that you need in the long-run, should be best acquired via <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="487">incremental reading</A>. Traditional reading can still be used for entertainment, temporary knowledge (e.g. how to install a sound board), curiosity (e.g. news), etc. This is not to say that speed-reading skills are not useful in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="488">incremental reading</A>.

In addition to massive imports, you can introduce your own rough notes into SuperMemo and later gradually convert them into well-structured knowledge. Less important material may remain unstructured and, as such, less well-remembered. You will see how passive notes gradually fade in your memory and how their individual components will need to be reinforced by formulating specific well-structured <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="492">items</A>. You will make such reinforcement decisions on the one-by-one basis depending on the importance of the fading material and the degree of recall problems. Naturally, due to a typical learning overflow, you will always neglect some portions of the material. This is how you will gain additional speed understood as the time invested per <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="493">item</A>. You will generate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="494">items</A> faster, re-formulate them with greater ease, and save additional time by neglecting less important material.

Here are some examples of skills that will get a boost and change your learning: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Recognizing suitable texts</B> at a glance of an eye. Some texts are great for efficient reading, some are full of chaff and waffle. The more articles you need to preview fast and prioritize, the faster you can do it and more accurate you become. This is an exercise in expert pattern recognition. 
<LI><B>Formulating knowledge</B> efficiently. In terms of learning efficiency, the difference between well-formulated and ill-formulated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="497">items</A> may be as high as 1:10 or even 1:100. Some <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="498">items</A> are mnemonic. Others are confusing. Some require 5-6 repetitions in a lifetime. Others permanently reside among <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Leech" oldtitle="Glossary:Leech" data-hasqtip="499">leeches</A> that come back for review and waste your precious time. 
<LI><B>Mnemonic skills</B>. The more you try to remember, the better you know how to remember things fast and for long. Mnemonic skills can be developed in dedicated courses. They can also improve with each single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="500">item</A> you formulate and memorize. 
<LI><B>Speed-reading skills</B>. Fast reading is a hallmark of incremental learning. Traditional speed-reading is very different from speed-reading with SuperMemo. You nearly never need to worry about missing information. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="501">Incremental reading</A> carries none of the burdens of a typical hit-and-miss speed-reading. There is no limit on the speed of skimming. Mastery of keyboard is as important as the eye <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccades</A>. The more you skim, the better you skim. The more you hurry, the more you skim. Incremental learning accelerates your hunger for knowledge, and the speed at which you devour it. 
<LI><B>Semantic skills</B>. The language is a jigsaw puzzle of words and phrases played on a set board of grammar. Understanding the language is vital for speed-reading where the structure of a sentence needs to be parsed in a fraction of a millisecond at a single glance. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="502">incremental reading</A>, correct formulation of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="503">clozes</A> will often require minor rewording. Like in a puzzle, you will need to shift a word from here to there, remove sections of sentences, insert context, change the tense, remove referential ambiguity, etc. Mastery of the grammatical sentence skeleton and the semantics will increase with every and each new <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="504">cloze</A> polished for long-term memory. 
<LI><B>Prioritizations skills</B>. New students, however smart, are often totally blind to the priority of knowledge. They are unable to judge the extent of their present and future knowledge. They find it difficult to differentiate gold from garbage. Seemingly precious knowledge becomes garbage if it does not pass the priority test that ensures it can ever be mastered. The lifetime capacity of the human brain is limited. Without understanding the limits, newcomers to incremental learning will often embark onto a futile quest for mastering details that would steal room needed for memories that are essential to one's existence (professional and beyond). With every passing month and with the constant increase in the size of your knowledge and your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="505">collection</A> (i.e. also "knowledge to-be"), you will better understand your ultimate limits. Your knowledge selection skills will keep improving for years to come. 
<LI><B>Editing and SuperMemo skills</B>. SuperMemo is complex. It takes months to fully explore. SuperMemo is also keyboard-oriented. The list of keyboard shortcuts is overwhelming. Only with the mastery of the keyboard and SuperMemo itself can you become a true pro of incremental learning who can whiz through dozens of articles per hour. You will edit dozens of little pieces of texts to optimally formulate your questions. Speed-reading and semantic skills, combined with editing skills will help you instantly mold the texts in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="506">collection</A> to suit your long-term goals.</LI></UL>

<H3><SPAN id=All-in-one_archive class=mw-headline>All-in-one archive</SPAN></H3>
<P>Once you become proficient with SuperMemo you can use it as an all-encompasing archive of all your media files. Those files do not need to be part of the learning process, however, you can combine archiving functions with the incremental process (e.g. when annotating your family photo album <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="508">collection</A>). SuperMemo may be a great way to get rid of those dusty paper documents, tape recorder cassettes, CDs, photo albums, school notebooks, etc. You can archive this in dedicated folders on your computer and import it all to SuperMemo. Incremental processing of archive has many advantages. For example, while annotating family pictures from two centuries ago, you can fill in the gaps in information by simple face recognition that may rely on a degree of learning or creative juxtaposition of photographs from different sources in close <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="509">intervals</A>. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_audio" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental audio" data-hasqtip="510">Incremental audio</A> can also convert your jukebox SuperMemo into a stream of music with a maximized fun factor. There are millions of ways of sorting tracks on your media player device, by filename, by date, by annotation, by priority, by recent viewing... all that does not compare to the incremental review process. This is because the quality of your experience when processing music or photos is based on the same forgetting mechanisms that affect learning. You want to see or listen to some things more often than others, but not too often. Forgetting is the key to experiencing music or imagery or videos again and again with a heightened degree of fun, pleasure and, last but not least, learning. </P>

<P>The sense of productivity might be one of the most satisfying emotions. This is why incremental learning should be highly enjoyable. This only magnifies its powers. To experience the elation of incremental learning, you may need a few months of focused practice. You will first have to start with the basic tools and techniques. Then you will need to master <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">knowledge representation skills</A>. Finally, you will need a couple of months of heavy-load incremental learning to perfect the details and develop your own "incremental learning philosophy". You will also need to grow your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="511">collection</A> as size matters for the fun of learning. Last but not least, incremental learning requires good language skills, some touch-typing skills, and patience (SuperMemo will often want you to go against your own intuition). Although the material is originally imported from electronic sources, it always needs to be molded, shortened, provided with context clues, restructured for wording and grammar, etc. The skills involved are not trivial and require practice. </P>
<P>If you have used SuperMemo and/or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="512">spaced repetition</A>, you may have concluded that learning with SuperMemo is boring due to its repetitive nature. Those who can compare the classic SuperMemo with incremental learning will testify that incremental learning is by far more fun. In contrast to classic SuperMemo, where you focus on the review of the old material, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="513">incremental reading</A> interweaves the old with the new. Novelty adds to the fun and efficiency of learning. Incremental learning is by far more challenging and colorful than typical repetitions. In addition to review and reading, you can import rich graphics, audio and video to spice up your learning process. </P>
<P>In the end, you risk becoming seriously addicted to incremental learning. The statement "<I>I do not read books</I>" should no longer be considered in a negative light! As long as you keep incremental learning in rational check, it will benefit you and others around you. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Disadvantages class=mw-headline>Disadvantages</SPAN></H2>
<P>Most of disadvantages of incremental learning come from factors that are a disadvantage in nearly all human pursuits: opportunity and overhead costs. However, there are also disadvantages that come from the fact that <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Incremental_learning_is_not_for_everyone">Incremental learning is not for everyone</A>. Poor selection of knowledge may result in wasting time on low-quality learning. Moreover, incremental learning may lead to frustration, stress, addiction, compulsive use, and other undesirable effects on user's psychology. </P>
<P>Here is the short list of disadvantages to consider: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>opportunity costs</B>: each time you learn with SuperMemo, you are not doing something else. You might be neglecting your creative pursuits, other people, your children, your own health, etc. Incremental learning makes sense only if it is done in the right proportion to your other activities. That proportion will depend on your skills, goals, profession, lifestyle, personality, and more. You need to strike the optimum balance on your own. It might be just a few minutes to polish your English or professional knowledge. Or it might be a few hours if you are a medical student. You always need to keep opportunity costs in mind and keep a score of costs and benefits. 
<LI><B>overhead costs</B>: there is no way around a steep learning curve in incremental learning. You will be thwarted by limitations of software, and the overall complexity of the concept. You will wonder why some solutions in SuperMemo have been set upside down against your best intuition. You will keep improving your skills, and strategies over long months and years. Even mastering the basic techniques will take a lot of time. You should be aware of that difficulty before you embark on the process that is bound to cause some stress and frustration at the beginning. At the same time, you should find hope in the fact that for a pro, the overhead costs are negligible. All extra operations are semi-automatic while the learning process proceeds largely uninterrupted in student's mind. While keystrokes are issued, knowledge is actively being processed by the memory system. All operations have been optimized for pro use. Once you get to a pro level and follow the recommended strategy, overhead cost disadvantage will cease to matter. 
<LI><B>learning garbage</B> (GIGO): if your selection of learning material is poor, or your formulation skills inadequate, you risk wasting lots of time on learning things that you do not need or that do not bring a tangible memory effect. This is why you must read <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules of formulating knowledge</A>, keep <A title="Incremental learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Selecting_knowledge">knowledge selection</A> at the front of your mind, and be honest with your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="514">priority queue</A>. 
<LI><B>frustration and stress</B>: incremental learning is not for everyone. It requires a certain level of proficiency with the language that may be hard for some to reach. It requires a mind that is somewhat abstract-enabled. Did you do well in math? Or science? These are good omens. If incremental learning is not fun after a few months of determined study, you need to re-read this entire article with utmost attention. Otherwise, your incremental adventure will not bring fruit.</LI></UL>

<P>In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="526">incremental reading</A>, you always need to quickly recover the context of a question or a piece of text.

References propagate from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="527">element</A> to element as you produce <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="528">extracts</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="529">cloze deletions</A>.

<P>References are not stored in HTML files that hold your articles but in a reference <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="531">registry</A> (i.e. in a separate database).

All reference texts are held in the text <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="532">registry</A> and are available for global text searches. In earlier versions of SuperMemo, each text would keep its own copy of references. In newer SuperMemos, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="533">elements</A> keep only pointers to reference <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="534">registry</A>, which in turn keeps pointers to individual text fields in the text registry. As a result, many <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="535">elements</A> can hold the same reference, and many references can hold the same text.

More importantly, you can update the reference in a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="537">element</A> and see the change show in all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="538">elements</A> using the same reference.

<P>You an use <B>Reference: Edit</B> in <A title="SuperMemo Commander" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Commander">SuperMemo Commander</A>, however, you can also edit references in the reference area (which is pink in the default stylesheet). You can safely delete reference fields, but you need to decide if that change should be local (for that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="568">element</A> only) or global (for all elements using this reference). You will not be able to delete <SPAN class=reference>#Article</SPAN>, <SPAN class=reference>#Parent:</SPAN> or <SPAN class=reference>#Concept group</SPAN> fields because they are added automatically to the reference section (i.e. they are not part of the reference itself). You can freely change the text of references. Illegal changes are all changes that do not comply with the reference format, e.g. lines that do not start with reference field tags, or lines that start with unknown reference field tags (e.g. <I>#Country</I>). If you are unsure how this process works, import a single article from <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> to a newly created <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="569">collection</A>, create some <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="570">extracts</A> and play with editing to see how references are processed. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Image_references class=mw-headline>Image references</SPAN></H2>
<P>Image references are created automatically when importing from the web or from an HTML document. In SuperMemo 16, unless you imported images with whole references pages, duplicate detection would depend on image names. If you renamed your images to make reuse easy, duplicate detection wouldn't work. This changed with SuperMemo 17. URLs are kept in the text <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Registry" oldtitle="Glossary:Registry" data-hasqtip="571">registry</A> which can accept a degree of "garbage" as text reuse is automatic. The adopted complex solution may make SuperMemo a bit slower when importing images from imported articles or when importing pictures from the web. However, your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="572">collection</A> is unlikely to swell with multiple image duplicates. Duplicate imports are automatically prevented and the imported image is replaced with the stored original (wiki thumbs are replaced with their high-resolution originals). </P>

<P>Best articles for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="577">incremental reading</A> are fact-rich and context-rich. You need to develop your own rules for selecting quality reading material. Nothing can substitute for your own experience. You will learn to identify texts that are hard to process and yield lower reading efficiency. </P>
<P>Let's consider two extremes: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Wikipedia</B>: <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> is great because it is crowd-sourced and many authors edit only a small section of a text in total abstraction of the rest of the article. This is why even a small portion of the text (as in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="578">incremental reading</A>) will usually contain all relevant context 
<LI><B>Fiction</B>: Fiction is best read linearly and you can just use a paper bookmark in a paper book to do as well as you would do with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="579">incremental reading</A></LI></UL>
<P>Many articles fall in between <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> and fiction extremes. Where <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> would say "the http protocol", a typical article might just say "the protocol" (if "the" is clear from preceding passages). Some text are peppered with "as I mentioned in the previous chapter", or "go to the next section", or "the three points explained in the previous chapter", etc. Abuse of working memory in text writing makes <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="580">incremental reading</A> difficult. This means that if authors use a lot of "referential ambiguity", the texts are not good for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="581">incremental reading</A>. Example ambiguity keywords: "the", "they", "he", "it", etc. </P>
<P>Many articles are also filled with irrelevant chaff (<A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com">super-memory.com</A> isn't impervious to that weakness). Too much beating about the bush without clearly stating the conclusions that are most important to the reader. "Speculative philosophy" might be a good inspirational read, but probably not for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="582">incremental reading</A>. You need to decide. </P>
<P>Some narratives should just best be read passively. They may be a compilation of facts that are generally obvious. In such cases you can just read and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Dismiss" oldtitle="Glossary:Dismiss" data-hasqtip="583">dismiss</A>. Or you can read and schedule another review in a month or in a year (if you worry you miss something important). Or you can try to write, in your own words, a sentence or two on what new things you have learned from the narrative. Your sentence would shortly extract the quintessence from an otherwise lengthy passage. If it is meaningful and quintessential, you shall find little trouble with locating keywords suitable for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="584">clozing</A>. </P>
<P>You need to develop your own rules for deciding which articles are good for reading. The chief rule might be: import anything that looks interesting, start reading, and if you recognize tell-tale problems, just deprioritize or delete or fish for a few highlights and then delete. </P>
<P>Remember that you need to differentiate between <A href="#Example:_Unsuitable_texts">unsuitable texts</A> and <A href="#Handling_incomprehensible_articles">difficult texts</A>. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Handling_incomprehensible_articles class=mw-headline>Handling incomprehensible articles</SPAN></H2>
<P>In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="585">incremental reading</A>, you will often encounter material that is difficult to understand. You will need to develop analytical skills that will help you identify the reasons for the difficulties. If the culprit is the author, delete the article. If you need to digest other pieces of your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="586">collection</A> first, delay the article. If you need more knowledge, delay the article and import more knowledge that will be needed to boost understanding. Do not forget that <B>some texts make an inherently poor material for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="587">incremental reading</A></B> (e.g. descriptions of scientific experiments, mathematical derivations, programming examples in source code, case studies, etc.). In such cases, use traditional methods of thorough analysis, summarize results of your analysis, and use SuperMemo to keep track of your own summaries. See: <A href="#Recognizing_unsuitable_texts">Recognizing unsuitable texts</A> (incl. <A href="#Example:_Unsuitable_texts">example</A>). </P>
<P>This is how you can approach complexity in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="588">incremental reading</A>: </P>

<P>In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="616">incremental reading</A>, you achieve highest efficiency if your process knowledge in small steps separated in time. This way you can accomplish a good memory effect at little processing effort. However, many users fall into traps of inefficiency where too little or too much work is done on a subject in a single review. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Futile_review class=mw-headline>Futile review</SPAN></H3>
<P>Futile review is an example of insufficient work done (one action, zero memory). Futile review is born in this mental scenario: you see a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="617">topic</A> and think: <I>I am in no mood for this material now. Let's execute <B>Next repetition</B>.</I> This is wrong! You must take action or you will loop into wasting time and learning little! It is a cardinal sin to execute processing operations without actually learning anything. When a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="618">topic</A> arrives, you may have a dozen of excuses: "<I>I do not like this one. Let's do it tomorrow</I>". Or "<I>I am too sleepy for this one</I>". Or "<I>This one will take too much time.</I>" If you find yourself in a loop and constantly rescheduling the same <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="619">topic</A>, or spending time rescheduling a number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="620">topics</A>, you are hurting the efficiency of learning! This is the time that could be spent on more productive steps. </P>
<P>If you do not want <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="621">incremental reading</A> to become a waste of time, you must <B>always take some action</B> when you see a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="622">topic</A>. For example: </P>
<UL>
<LI>read a sentence and delete it, or mark as <SPAN class=ignore>ignore</SPAN>, or extract it 
<LI>if the article is not vital for your further progress, set low <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="623">priority</A> (e.g. 99%) 
<LI>for the material that you won't have time for in a month or more, set the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="624">interval</A> (e.g. to 333 days)</LI></UL>
<P>In other words, either make tiny inroads into the text, or mark it clearly as low priority or to-be-done later. Consider also <B><A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Delete_element">Delete</A></B> or <B><A title="Element menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu#Done">Done!</A></B> </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Item_perfectionism class=mw-headline>Item perfectionism</SPAN></H3>
<P>Another facet of the same problem is taking too many actions on a single piece of information. It is highly inefficient to work on colors, fonts, pictures, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="625">priorities</A>, etc. during a single repetition. All those actions can be spread over time. Naturally, setting the right <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="626">priority</A> is one of the most important steps. Perhaps a piece of information is not important enough to ever squeeze through your crowded learning. If so, you will save tons of time on not doing colors and styles. </P>
<P>Here also you should remember: <B>one memory, one action</B>. Each time you review a piece of information, you are allowed to do an edit, font change, template change, concept group change, etc. However, unless you can do all your actions in a single burst of machine gun keyboard strikes, or unless some actions are associated with learning new things, you should rather limit your actions to a single step per single repetition. </P>
<P><B>One memory, one action</B> rule demands that <B>every operation in incremental learning should leave a trace in your memory</B>. It also says that <B>one operation on a piece of data is better than two operations at the same time</B> </P>

<P>However, the <A class="external text" href="https://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules</A> were written in 1999 for classical SuperMemo. Incremental learning is incremental across the spectrum of rules and principles. In particular, formulating <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="628">items</A> and building understanding are incremental too. </P>
<P>According to the <B>one memory, one action</B> principle, the presented <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="629">item</A> will assume its final shape some time in the undefined future (or never, if its <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="630">priority</A> is not high enough). It must be processed incrementally due to the following factors: </P>
<OL>
<LI>incremental build up of comprehension, and 
<LI>incremental reformulation that requires time.</LI></OL>
<P>The <A class="external text" href="https://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules</A> say "<B>Do not memorize until you understand</B>", however, understanding is also an incremental process. Converting this <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="631">item</A> to plain "<I>What eicosanoids attract white blood cells?</I>" might make sense only if the student fully understands and remembers the hierarchy of inflammation factors, and involved eicosanoids. If this is not the case, carrying the context in the shape of this complex <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="632">item</A> is a form of transitional stage between a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="633">topic</A> and an <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="634">item</A>. The <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="635">item</A> still asks the question vital for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall" data-hasqtip="636">active recall</A>. However, it also makes sure that full context is provided until the rest of the knowledge structure is firmly established in student's mind. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="637">incremental reading</A>, the order of reading is often chaotic, the understanding is incremental, and the effort to build a solid knowledge structure is gradual too. </P>
<P>In addition to the incremental buildup of comprehension, extensive edits of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="638">items</A> are costly (esp. a total rewrite of the item to a plain question). In fact, one of the main advantages of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="639">incremental reading</A> is the minimum need for typing. This is why we use electronic sources in the first place (instead of just books that offer no disadvantage when entire <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="640">items</A> are typed in anyway). This is why an important efficiency principle in incremental learning is to minimize edits by complying with the <B>one memory, one action</B> principle. </P>
<P>Let us see how the presented <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="641">item</A> might evolve in successive repetitions. Note that all edit steps my proceed only with solidification of related knowledge (i.e. a single repetition may actually bring no edits at all). The execution of those steps will also be somewhat dependent on item <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="642">priority</A>. High priority items will receive more exposure, more processing and will demand better formulation quality. </P>

<P>Lists and sets are difficult to remember. It is hard to remember the whole set of countries that belong to the European Union. When learning lists, you should rather decompose the problem into smaller subproblems. </P>
<P>Let us consider an example in which you want to memorize the entire sequence of letters in the alphabet. It won't be very effective if you use the following item: </P>

<P>You will notice that you frequently stumble on parts of the sequence and need to stop repetitions just to exercise the entire sequence in the traditional way (like we all learn poems by rote). </P>
<P>However, you can approach this in a way that guarantees quick effects: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>etc. etc.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After 2-3 weeks of repetitions, you may take on an extra task of recalling the whole sequence after each repetition of these simplified <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="644">items</A>. This will make sure you can recite the entire alphabet quickly. You will also frequently rehearse that parts of the sequence that are harder for your memory (e.g. <I>V, W, X, Y, Z</I>) as opposed to those that are much simpler (e.g. <I>A, B, C, D, E</I>). </P>

<P>You may develop a good methodology for memorizing lists in SuperMemo. However, you may later discover that the memorized lists are not very useful in real life, or worse, your memory may fail you when you undergo a baptism of fire.

<P>It is hard to formulate a simple algorithm for deciding when to preview the whole article before reading, and/or when to extract the most important fragments during a preview. After all, the article can also be read incrementally in a linear sequence. This is a case a multi-criterial optimization where many factors must be taken into account and the ultimate decision will depend on your own preferences. </P>
<P>Here are some criteria: </P>
<UL>
<LI>if you need this knowledge today, you should start with a quick preview and extracting mission-critical fragments 
<LI>if this knowledge is very important and your learning process overflows with articles to read, extract-preview will increase your exposure to the article 
<LI>if the article is not very interesting, line-at-a-time reading will be equivalent to assigning a lower <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="663">priority</A> (you will just read a sentence once per week or once per month and you may never finish the article unless it gets more relevant or interesting) 
<LI>if you believe the article contains very important pieces in its body, you may want to quickly locate these and extract them for separate (more detailed) reading 
<LI>if your reviews occur in very long <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="664">intervals</A> as a result of slow reading, you may opt for shortening the interval or running a preview of the most important sections instead 
<LI>if you are reading texts from your e-mail <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Tasklist" oldtitle="Glossary:Tasklist" data-hasqtip="665">tasklist</A>, preview is highly recommended: not all people start their messages with the most important points and you certainly would not want to delay locating paragraphs requiring immediate action with weeks of delay 
<LI>if you import from <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>, high priority articles can be split automatically (with <B>Split: Split the article</B> in the <B><A title="SuperMemo Commander" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Commander">Commander</A></B>), and you can assign <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="666">priorities</A> to individual subsections</LI></UL>

<P>Conversion to HTML is most convenient and least expensive. However, some converters and/or some PDFs produce HTML that is quite different than the original, and/or difficult to process in SuperMemo (e.g. requiring extra filtering, or extra manual formatting). Page snapshots are a fast way to read and import pages that are difficult to convert or are read only (e.g. manuals that require a specific page layout). Copy and paste approach is best for articles that can easily be selected in their entirety and which do not contain too many pictures. Finally, the incremental approach is most natural for SuperMemo, however, instead of using <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Read-point" oldtitle="Glossary:Read-point" data-hasqtip="691">read-points</A>, the student needs to make a note where he or she stopped reading the text. </P>

<H3><SPAN id=PDF_to_HTML_converters class=mw-headline>PDF to HTML converters</SPAN></H3>
<P>As SuperMemo cannot host PDF files natively for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="692">incremental reading</A>, the most promising long-term solution is the use of PDF to HTML converters. However, all converters have their limitations. The languages defined by HTML and PDF are not equivalent. Not all expressions of PDF can be expressed in HTML. This is why you need to check a few converters and see which one is best at processing your type of learning material. </P>

<P>Some students use MS Word as an intermediary stage in conversion to HTML. However, as much as the conversion of PDF to HTML is never complete and accurate, there are differences between PDF and MS Word that make life difficult. At the moment of writing, there aren't any tools that would reliably convert PDF to MS Word format. Pasting from Adobe Reader to MS Word yields poor results (e.g. texts in columns lose or mix portions of texts). If you own MS Word, you can give it a try, however, using converters or <A href="#Incremental_reading_of_PDF_articles">other methods</A> will probably work better. </P>

<P>If <A href="#PDF_to_HTML_converters">conversion of PDF to HTML</A> is not satisfactory, you may need to resort to old plain copy&amp;paste. Some PDF texts paste whole chapters pretty well with little extra text/code (e.g. page headings). Some PDFs respond well to <I>Ctrl+A</I> (for selecting all text) and <B>Copy with Formatting</B> (right click). Usually, Adobe Reader will not let you do multi-page selections that would paste to SuperMemo fast and nicely. You may even get annoyed with your attempts to copy a multi-column portion of a single page. You will get one column selected, middle of the second, and the ending of the third. Other double-column texts will paste as a mix of both columns per line. Sometimes pasting multi-column texts is not possible. This means that you will often need to go from page to page, or even column to column, and repeat copy&amp;paste. That can take ages. Similarly, pictures do not copy as part of HTML. So you need to copy&amp;paste pictures separately. Here again, when Adobe Reader will not let you copy pictures easily, you can just use <B>Print Screen</B>, paste to SuperMemo and trim&amp;crop in SuperMemo (see: <A href="#PDF_with_visual_learning">Visual learning</A>). Tables are usually best processed in the form of pictures as they usually import poorly to HTML. Some PDF documents do not even allow of selecting texts. In those cases you will need to resort to <A href="#PDF_with_visual_learning">PDF visual learning</A> too. Sometimes you may just give up and read the article straight without bothering to do it incrementally, or look for alternative texts, or just give up reading altogether. You can also read the article using traditional methods, and copy to SuperMemo only the portions that you would normally extract within SuperMemo. </P>
<P>After pasting text from Adobe Reader to SuperMemo, it will often be jagged, disrupted, wrongly formatted, etc. Converting short passages to plain text often dramatically improves readability. The shortcut is <I>Ctrl+Shift+F12</I>. </P>

<P>Incremental learning is powerful. Even though we strongly believe it might spell a revolution in learning, its present incarnation will reach only a small fraction of society. This is why: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Most of people will never arrive to this website. A great part of this planet do not have access to the Internet. Of those who are privileged enough to be able to use <A class="external text" href="http://google.com">Google</A> or <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> on a regular basis, most are too busy with work, family and other pursuits. The rest are busy with <A class="external text" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</A>, games and other "blessings" of the Internet. 
<LI>A significant fraction of the users of the Internet realize that the web offers incredible self-help opportunities. However, a substantial portion of those will suffer from a cognitive bias known as the <B>illusion of knowledge</B>. This bias does not spare highly intelligent individuals. Under the illusion of knowledge, we are less motivated to seek more learning. With less learning, the learn drive diminishes with age providing a negative feedback of inaction 
<LI>Users of the Internet who are highly interested in learning quickly discover that their memory can be improved, and that their learning can be advanced to a new level with some help from the net or software. However, the language barrier is another big sieve. The best materials about learning techniques have been published in English. Language divisions result in a global inequality in the access to information. You can read about SuperMemo in a couple of major languages. Perhaps you might learn about <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="704">incremental reading</A> too. The article you are reading now will take months or years to percolate to non-English areas of the net! 
<LI>For anyone interested in learning, it does not take long to find out about <I><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="705">spaced repetition</A></I>. The term was quite exotic when first used in the context of SuperMemo in the mid 1990s. In those days it could only be found in a couple of scientific publications. However, it was SuperMemo that helped popularize the concept, which now has entered the popular culture. Those who seek better memory will quickly be informed that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="706">spaced repetition</A> is the way. They will get their introduction to <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="707">spaced repetition</A> from <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/english/down.htm">SuperMemo freeware</A>, or an array of other excellent free spaced repetition applications, some of which use older SuperMemo algorithms. The fact that the newest SuperMemo is a commercial product will prevent many potentially excellent students from ever going in the direction of incremental learning. This must be made clear then. At the moment of writing, <A class="external text" href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/SuperMemo_program_13849.html">SuperMemo 2004 is freeware</A> and supports <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="708">incremental reading</A>. It might be missing the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="709">priority queue</A>, but this will matter only much later in the process when you build a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="710">collection</A> of unmanageable size.

That's the core of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="711">incremental reading</A>! 
<LI>Among users of SuperMemo, only a fraction will ever become interested in a complex concept of incremental learning (probably still below 5%). A typical newcomer is more likely to drop out altogether than to move on to the next level. The chief culprit is the incompatibility of SuperMemo with the human nature and the modern lifestyle. Stressful and busy lives do not help in forging new paths and acquiring new habits. It is not just that humans like to live in their comfort zones. It is also that the pressures of the modern dog-eat-dog society are pretty effective in stifling higher inspiration, lifelong learning, creative pursuits beyond one's job, etc. Those issues are inherent (human nature), or systemic. As such they cannot be easily remedied. 
<LI>Some users might hold a relatively positive opinion about <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="712">incremental reading</A>, but will excuse their lack of commitment by technological limitations of SuperMemo. For example, "<I>unless you give me a Mac version, I won't go there</I>", "<I>I hate Internet Explorer</I>", "<I>Your interface comes from Windows 98 era</I>" or "<I>I will come back if you have a mobile version</I>". Incidentally, there is an inherent incompatibility between mobility and incremental learning. Mobility correlates with multitasking and low attention (interaction with others, social media notifications, arriving mail, phone calls, browser pop-ups, etc.). The power of incremental learning lies in balancing creativity with attention. As such, incremental learning is inherently immobile (unless you understand mobility as a transfer between two or more peaceful and static environments). In addition, without a standard-size keyboard, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="713">incremental reading</A> might feel like paddling up the creek. 
<LI>Among those users of SuperMemo who get down to reading about incremental learning, a large proportion will come with a preconceived goal: proving that incremental learning is not really worth the investment of time. "Negative reading" is more likely to occur in a bad state of mind: low-spirits, irritation, or reading outside one's <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Optimizing_the_timing_of_brainwork">optimum circadian brainwork bracket</A>. This preconception may be largely subconscious and based on a defense mechanism: proving that incremental learning is a weak concept is easy, should save one a great deal of investment in mastering the concept, and prevent the need to leave one's comfort zone. Discovering that incremental learning is a must will simply augur long hours of plodding through the documentation that is notorious for its poor readability index. The presented article is harder to read than 70% of articles at <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>. The ultimate judgement is strongly correlated with your present state of mind. You are more likely to say "<I>Incremental learning is full of fluff</I>" or "<I>Incremental learning goes against human nature</I>" than to say "<I>I have discovered a new great technology that will change my life</I>". You might be just seeking affirmation of your preset frame of mind: "<I>Incremental learning must be a hoax or at least a waste of time</I>", or simply "<I>Incremental learning is not of much use in my particular profession</I>". It is easy to find the desired confirmation. Imperfections in this article will provide a rich material for dismissal. A perfection is not achievable. Prejudiced mind will always find a way to misinterpret. Naturally, if you are enthusiastic about incremental learning at your first encounter, this is a very good predictor of your ultimate success. 
<LI>Having passed all this rich obstacle course, you are now bound to be in a tiny group of people who arrived at this point. The good news is that you might be part of a special elite. People with fertile minds who are open to new challenges, motivated well enough and self-disciplined enough. Naturally, you might have equally well come here exhausted with your failure in learning, in hope of finding a remedy to your recent bad exam results. Whatever the answer, the road is still very long. Even with a brisk mind and great enthusiasm, you may still drop out at later stages. 
<LI>When reading about incremental learning, you might hit another major obstacle: "<I>This is more convoluted than I thought!</I>", or "<I>The whole idea of <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue">prioritization</A> makes me nauseous</I>", or "<I>The toolset may be rich but is it natural?</I>". You can get discouraged either by incomplete understanding of the concept, or the incompatibility of the concept with your personality. 
<LI>If you have already decided to try incremental learning, and you have <A class="external text" href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html">SuperMemo 17</A> installed, you may get an unpleasant shock. <A class="external text" href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html">SuperMemo 17</A> is not user friendly! It has been optimized for pro users and only simplified enough at lower levels (<B><A title="File menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu">File</A>&nbsp;: <A title=Levels href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Levels">Level</A></B>) to make it somewhat palatable for a novice. You can overcome this impression only with a firm belief: incremental learning works and it is worth the investment of my time. After a year, you may love the solutions you hated in SuperMemo at first. User unfriendliness and complexity will make many give up in the first days or weeks. Those dropouts rarely return! We are guilty here too. New solutions are never perfectly encapsulated and/or interfaced. You will get your neat iPad and Android version only when incremental learning is more popular, which is not anytime soon. 
<LI>The dropout rate in the first weeks is still high. Some of the main problems: importing unsuitable text, difficulty in parsing the text with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="714">extracts</A>, losing context of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="715">extracts</A>, comprehension problems (not related to SuperMemo), <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="716">clozing</A> texts that are too complex, <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">difficulty in formulating items</A>, excessive time spent on formatting and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Template" oldtitle="Glossary:Template" data-hasqtip="717">templates</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="718">learning overload</A>, confusion, problems with SuperMemo (e.g. layouts), lack of sense of progress, etc. Without clear gratification, many users come to the conclusion that the cost is greater than the benefits. They are not wrong. It is not easy to get a return on your investment in a month or even longer. Few users start their learning swiftly on a wave of solid enthusiasm! 
<LI>Many of the advantages of incremental learning rely on the size of your learning <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="719">collection</A>. The value of <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Search_and_review">search&amp;review</A> increases with the size of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="720">collection</A>. At the beginning of the process, when <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="721">collection</A> is small, and as a result knowledge-poor, you may feel like laying the first brick of a large pyramid on a vast boring desert. The greatest fun can be found at the top of the pyramid, when you can see the extent of your knowledge in a good perspective. This metaphor should not imply your pyramid will ever stop growing. You keep adding stone blocks to the sides. The pyramid keeps growing high and wide for lifetime. 
<LI>The extent of failure does not only cover the dropouts and the never-has-beens. Even long-term users may enter a never-ending struggle with <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">knowledge formulation</A>, complex material, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="722">priorities</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="723">overload</A>, etc. The later you start, the longer the transition from pain to fun. Old habits die hard. There is one clear litmus test for success: once incremental learning is fun, you know you do things right. If you have not reached the level of fun after a couple of months of trying hard, you need to re-think your strategies. For example, you may need to start from reading this article cover-to-cover again. 
<LI>If you happen to be a happy user of incremental learning, your knowledge will keep growing fast, and your hunger for learning will keep increasing at an ever faster rate. This makes you a part of a very tiny elite. This also imposes an obligation. It is time to help others reach your level!</LI></UL>
<H2><SPAN id=Big_picture_in_incremental_learning class=mw-headline>Big picture in incremental learning</SPAN></H2>
<P>A frequent reservation voiced by skeptical observers is that dismembering texts into little units will result in an inevitable loss of the ability to see things from a distance in their entirety. The question is: <I>Does incremental learning produce a loss of the big picture?</I> What the skeptics fail to appreciate is the power of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="724">spaced repetition</A> that stands behind SuperMemo. The SuperMemo method ensures high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="725">retention</A> of once-mastered knowledge. This means that there is minimum disintegration of the coherence of knowledge once it is understood and well modeled in student's mind. </P>
<P><B>The main advantage of SuperMemo is that you convert lots of disparate pieces of information into a solid model of reality that lives in your memory</B>. All these pieces can be dispersed randomly in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="726">collection</A> like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, however, they fit into a coherent entirety that stays firmly intact in your mind. In other words, incremental learning is reductionist at the level of knowledge processing, but is holistic at the level of memories stored in your brain. </P>
<P>The big picture worry comes from the fact that in traditional education, students rely heavily on their short-term memory. They cram a single subject intensely before an exam only to forget most of that knowledge in the following months unless the subject is reviewed in later courses. It is true that short-term memory can act as a glue that holds the big picture in memory. However, it is the short-term memory and the weakest long-term memories that are gone first. With that in mind, it is only natural that you might worry that if you start intermingling more than a few courses, you will end up with chaos and confusion. It is not the case with incremental learning. New memories, once established, are gradually reinforced to permanently enter the long-term storage. All incremental learning does is to help you focus on a small portion of the material at any given moment. </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<P><B>In traditional (unspaced) education, the big picture is maintained with the glue of short-term memories. As such it is volatile, and subject to forgetting. In incremental learning, the big picture has a lasting value!</B> </P></DIV>

Once the big picture resides in your long-term memory, you can play with details to your heart's content. Today, tomorrow, or in a couple of years. </P>

<P>User of classical SuperMemo, T. Sz. wondered: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-comment">
<P><I>If I use incremental learning for a couple of years. How will that affect how I am perceived by others? Will they see the difference? Will I be smarter and appear smarter? Will I be able to shine with knowledge in social circles? What do people say after 20 years of using incremental learning?</I> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Incremental learning is just a few years old. For example, incremental reading was introduced in 2000. The essential concept of the <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority queue</A> was introduced only in 2006. Without the priority queue, massive learning may lead to massive chaos. <A title="Incremental video" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_video">Incremental video</A> was born in 2009. So you won't find users with 20 years of experience. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_learning_is_faster class=mw-headline>Incremental learning is faster</SPAN></H3>
<P>Despite the young age of incremental learning, it is easy to theorize about its power. This is because learning incrementally isn't much different than its ultimate effect as other forms of learning (e.g. extensive reading, studying for the university, research, etc.). For that reason, the results will be comparable. The main difference is that you will get to the levels of higher knowledge much faster (assuming sufficient skills). This way, someone with a few months of intense incremental learning, may get the knowledge and act not much different than a university graduate. Naturally, incremental learning will not substitute for laboratory practice, problem solving, discussions with friends, and professors, etc. So there will be differences. You can then ask: <I>How does the university education make me into a better person?'</I>. Once you answer that question, you will have an answer about incremental learning. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=No_amount_of_learning_can_eliminate_ignorance class=mw-headline>No amount of learning can eliminate ignorance</SPAN></H3>
<P>If you hope that incremental reading will make you universally knowledgeable and smart, you are wrong. Human knowledge is vast enough for a 2-year-old to know things that a PhD does not know (esp. if the kid is trained for the trick, e.g. to answer "<I>What is the capital of Burkina Faso?</I>"). </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_readers_are_different class=mw-headline>Incremental readers are different</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental reading is more likely to be less focused and more general. At the university, you may learn extensively on a specific subject, while in incremental reading you are more likely to stray to multiple related areas depending on your interests and the encountered gaps in knowledge. Your priorities will reflect your individual profile and your knowledge may be far more customized to your own needs and passions. All in all, an incremental reader will not differ much from a well-learned person. The main difference may show in personality. Not because of incremental learning but due to the fact that only a few have the mental characteristics needed to get interested and then sustain the incremental reading process. Thus incremental readers may appear more knowledgeable just because of their natural curiosity or even obsession with knowledge. This quest for general knowledge may result in short moments of amazement with the gaps in knowledge exhibited by other people. In September 2013, scientists announced that <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager 1</A> entered the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium">interstellar medium</A>. A panel of high-IQ journalists on a respected news channel discussed that historic moment. One of the journalists mentioned that Voyager 1 was launched in the 1990s and has now left the solar system. The other journalists nodded. This is where an obsessive incremental reader may pause and realize that he or she is indeed a bit different. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Nobody_likes_a_smart_aleck class=mw-headline>Nobody likes a smart aleck</SPAN></H3>
<P>It is not how others perceive you that matters, but how you change your thinking and the ability to solve problems. In most cases, few people in your surroundings care about your problems and your goals. The knowledge you obtain for those goals will be of little interest to others (beyond a narrow circle of close friends). If you ever attempt to show off at parties, you will rather be politely dismissed as an annoyance. Being a <A class="external text" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smart%20aleck">smart aleck</A> is universally perceived in a negative light. If you shine with your knowledge in a relevant context (i.e. not for the sake of shining), the perception will be different. We all love the doctor that can provide an accurate diagnosis at a glance and instantly come up with a solution to your health problem. However, chances are rather slim that you will be able to show off your specialist knowledge at a party (unless it is a professional party of your colleagues in the field). </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Reward_in_higher_awareness class=mw-headline>Reward in higher awareness</SPAN></H3>
<P>The greatest advantage of incremental reading may show in the areas of general knowledge. These are the areas that most of people neglect due to a simple lack of time and lack of sufficient pressure or motivation. A student may need to study for his geography course, a medical researcher may need to read dozens of papers, but they both may have too little time or need to refresh the ABC of physics that might otherwise be useful in understanding things that happen around them. An obsessive incremental reader might therefore reach a sort of higher level of awareness. If you hear about a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Chaffinch">chaffinch</A> for the first time in your life, you might likely say "<I>I have never seen that bird</I>". However, you might then be amazed if you see the bird a few times in the course of the following week. </P>
<P>With a narrow focus, few people are able to point to the galaxies that are likely to collide with the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">Milky Way</A>. Knowledge and understanding of similar facts and processes may seem to have little application to daily activities, however, it does seem to change how people view their place in the universe. Ignorance is blind. Knowledge makes you see things that others do not see. That should be sufficient reward. </P>

<P>As explained in <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of Genius and Creativity</A>: <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm#Smart%20and%20dumb%20learning">Smart and dumb learning</A>, smart learning will help you get smarter. However, bad learning practices can result in a monumental waste of time. SuperMemo helps you eliminate the problem of forgetting. As such, it can also help you remember time-wasting garbage. The main rule of smart learning is: <B>learn what is highly applicable</B>. Learn things that change your life. Learning things that help you change the life of others. Rules are better than facts. You can employ probability or statistical formulas in dozens of contexts. If you memorize phone numbers, it won't make you much smarter. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_learning_can_make_you_dumber class=mw-headline>Incremental learning can make you dumber</SPAN></H3>
<P>We believe that incremental learning is the acme of learning in 2013. However, it can also make you dumber. If you take on heavy learning, you are bound to suffer from serious memory interference. This means that you will also forget much faster, esp. the things that you do not keep in SuperMemo. Instead of looking smarter, to the outside world, you might appear more forgetful and even absent-minded. You might forget events, promises, encounters, jokes, movies, and all those little memory things that we take for granted. Incidentally, this forgetfulness is also produced by <A class="external text" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</A>, and the like. In this chaotic modern world, we hardly ever have time to stop and ponder important things. These days you can buy a shower cabin or a sauna with speakers built in. It's a matter of time before you can engage into a conversation with your toilet. Perhaps you already chat with your Facebook friends while sitting on the toilet? This means that the last preserves of peaceful thinking and creativity are in danger of being swamped with information overload. This makes us smarter in a different way. However, without your rational intervention, it may work against your long-term success. The same is true about incremental learning, you must stay vigilant and learn only things that are highly relevant and applicable to your goals and your position in society. Turn off your phone in the night, leave your MP3 player at home when you go for a jogging, and keep your incremental reading in check and order. </P>

<P>Not all knowledge is of great value. Memorizing all tributaries of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">Amazon</A> may take precious time from other areas of learning.

<P>Your learning efforts must be based on high applicability of newly acquired skills and knowledge. If you memorize the whole phone book, your problem solving ability will increase only slightly (mostly through the beneficial effect of memory training on the health of your brain). On the other hand, a simple formula for <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_payoff">expected payoff</A> may affect all decisions you make in problem solving and in life in general. It can, for example, save you years of wasted investment in lottery tickets. Millions of people are enticed with huge lottery jackpots, yet they would never agree to give up their whole income for life in order to get it back at retirement in one-off payment, which is a frequent probabilistic payoff equivalent of taking part in lotteries. Using the terminology defined above, you will find most benefit in mastering and understanding highly abstract rules of logical thinking and decision making. </P>
<P>To accomplish smart learning, you will need to constantly pay utmost attention to what material you decide to study. You must avoid short-term gratification at the cost of long-term learning. It may be great fun to learn all Roman emperors and details of their interesting lives and rule. However, unless you study with a big picture in mind (e.g. in an attempt to understand why civilizations thrive or fall), you may benefit less than by struggling through less entertaining but highly applicable formulas of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_research">operation research</A>, which might, for example help you optimize your diet, investment, daily schedule, etc. In other words, <B>you cannot be guided by just the fun of learning but by your goals and needs</B>. In time, you will learn to see the link between long-term learning and long-term benefits. You will simply condition yourself to love beneficial learning. Hard study material can still provide instant gratification. </P>
<P>While you focus on your goals, you cannot forget about the overall context of human life. You cannot dig solely into studying car engines only because this happens to be your profession. This would put you at risk of developing a tunnel vision. You might spend years improving a liquid fuel engine efficiency while others would leap years by getting involved in lithium batteries or hydrogen engines. One of the main reasons for which companies go bankrupt is that their leadership fails to spot the change. As corporate darwinism eliminates short-sighted teams, future society will witness more and more intellectual darwinism. To understand the trends and the future, you need to study human nature, economics, sociology, history, neurophysiology, mathematics, computing sciences, and more. The more you lick, the stronger your <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm#Predicting%20the%20future">predictive powers</A> and your problem solving capacity and the creative strength. </P>
<P>Should we learn "trivia" such as "<I>Which year was the Internet born?</I>". <B>The concept of trivia is highly relative!</B> To a child in a kindergarten, the birth of the Internet is rather meaningless. At this stage of development, the child may find it difficult to grasp the concept of the Internet itself. Many parents will wait until the primary school before showing a web browser to their child. The value of putting the date on the birth of the Internet probably develops only in the context of an effort to understand the history of technological development. In this context, 1969 may be as important as the name of <A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm#Johannes%20Gutenberg">Gutenberg</A>. Only when multiple events of the 1960s and the 1970s dovetail together, the commissioning of ARPANET becomes meaningful. When we figure out that we landed the man on the moon before making the first connection via the net, 1969 looms larger. If we dig deeper, we may find it inspiring to know that when Charley Kline tried to log in on October 29, 1969, the network crashed as he typed the letter <I>G</I>. Imagine, you work on commissioning a major installation that you have worked on for several years. You know that the installation implements revolutionary concepts yet it keeps on crashing. You are about to lose heart. This may not necessarily be an emotional event, after all you also need to apply probability to deciding when to give up blind-alley pursuits even after years of investment. The juxtaposition of the small letter <I>G</I> and the groundbreaking concept of the interconnected world will help you see the big picture. If your concept is great enough, you will go on through another 100 crashes in hope of diagnosing the reason. That perseverance may seem to have little to do with "being smart", but it will make you into a winner (given a bit of luck). </P>
<P>Listen to other people's advice and valuations. The younger you are the more you should listen. In the end though, <B>it must be you who determines the criteria for sifting golden knowledge from trivia</B>. Only you can measure the value of knowledge in the light of your own goals. </P>
<P>Remember that not all knowledge can easily be formulated in a declarative manner. Remember then to use the power of your own neural networks: solve problems, practice your skills, compute, abstract, associate, etc. You and others may not be able to see or verbalize some rules but your brain will extract them in the course of practice. Once the rules have been developed, try to formulate them and write them down. This can be of benefit to you and others. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_that_assists_problem_solving class=mw-headline>Knowledge that assists problem solving</SPAN></H3>
<P>Problem solving in artificial intelligence can be used to mimic those mental faculties of a human being that we associate with intelligence and creativity. There are many approaches to problem solving such as deduction, induction, abduction, reasoning by analogy or probabilistic methods, neural networks approach, searching in state space, and more. And even though some of these can generate false conclusions or uncertain responses, they can all be expressed by means of deductive methods such as those used in theorem proving in mathematics. Deduction proceeds from axioms or premises towards true formulas or assertions through logical derivation using valid inference rules. The better the selection of assertions and the selection of inference rules, the broader the reasoning capacity of an expert system or human brain. Rich inferential knowledge stored in our memory makes us fast in thinking, creative, intelligent, efficient in problem solving, etc. Yet we need factual knowledge as the raw processing material for derivation. Even the creative vein and inspiration can be expressed in terms of multithreaded derivation and backtracking well formalized in logic programming. No magic fluids or reflections of the soul are involved here. Just a plain network of firing neurons recovering the encoded patterns of facts and rules. See also: <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of creativity and genius</A>. </P>
<P>To boost your problem solving capacity you need to master a great deal of inferential knowledge. If you learn about specific classes of problems to solve, you may need to choose between memorizing the outcome of inference or its individual steps. Both equip you with a formula for transforming knowledge into new quality. Learning derivation steps is costly. At the same time it can equip you with highly abstract derivation rules. You need to balance cost and benefit. We cannot blindly assume that it is better to derive answers to problems than to simply memorize the answers. In problems with multiple instances, we will tend to learn the derivation. For example, it is easier to learn how to derive the third power of X than to memorize all useful pairs: argument-result. On the other hand, most of people memorize the multiplication table at the time when they could still derive the result from bit-operations on binary numbers. Memorizing some 40 or so combinations seems more practicable, esp. that derivation always takes time and we make use of the multiplication table thousands of times in a lifetime. Here memorization saves hours and days in the lifetime perspective. Brain armed with rich factual and inferential knowledge will associate the most remote ideas and derive the most unexpected conclusions. Through a conscious control over this rich reasoning process, we have built the present civilization. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_that_assists_creativity class=mw-headline>Knowledge that assists creativity</SPAN></H3>
<P>Creativity is based on association of ideas. It is helpful to be born with a creative brain that keeps spewing new ideas in all circumstances. However, creativity can also be assisted. When you master a great deal of facts and rules in areas adjacent to the problem that you try to creatively solve or elaborate upon, your creativity gets enhanced. If you employ incremental learning, the association of random ideas will be a norm throughout the process. </P>
<P>All innovation in the history of science and technology is based on association. Forgetful memory can be helped with external sources of knowledge and each major scientific breakthrough is based on a series of smaller steps, many of which will be based on hours of search, trial-and-error and experimentation. The brain armed with extensive knowledge is more likely to come up with the needed associations. As in problem solving, inferential knowledge is also particularly valuable in creative efforts. The rules that you know, help you derive new truths, and associate these with all your current knowledge. </P>
<P>Two ideas do not come together to produce a great invention unless they sit in the same head. They either have to be called up at the same time or one has to come unexpectedly from the outside: </P>

<P>SuperMemo can help you be creative not only by combining various pieces of knowledge in your mind. It can help you generate new ideas while making repetitions! Creative associations do not come from the mere existence of two pieces of knowledge in your brain. Those two pieces of knowledge have to light up at the same time. Only this way can your brain make a connection. Strangely, a repetition related to genetically modified tomato can light up memories related to tomato juice, cucumbers, genetic disorders, take-home dinner, flu or even the silent <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Polar_Lander">Mars Polar Lander</A>.

<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_and_history class=mw-headline>Knowledge and history</SPAN></H3>
<P>Throughout the ages, knowledge was the cornerstone of human progress. From <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age">Stone Age</A> to <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age</A>, in pain, we have built a tiny oasis of civilization in ruthless expanses of the evolving universe. The history of the mankind is made of billions of individual lives that keep on sparking and fading. Born of self-preservation instincts imprinted by evolution, history books paint a picture of a constant string of wars, conflict of interest, loss and gain of influences, lust for power and submission to weaknesses of human nature. On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the evolution, the rational mind, kept on contributing to new findings, discoveries, technologies and philosophies. Progress has always hinged on discovering new truths and preserving them for posterity in form of stories, solutions, tools, books, and other carriers of information. Knowledge is the basis of human power, yet it constantly struggles with two forces that regularly diminish it: death and forgetting. We can preserve knowledge in books and other forms of information storage. However, this knowledge translates to value only then when it is used by the creative power of the human brain. The limitations of the human brain will remain a bottleneck of progress for many years to come. We will develop artificially intelligent knowledge processors not earlier than in a decade or two. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_and_death class=mw-headline>Knowledge and death</SPAN></H3>
<P>Death poses an ageless challenge to educating new generations. Years of hard work needed to gain knowledge on professorial level are obliterated in a single act of death. Newborns need to go through years of education before they are able to access, read, and comprehend this text. They all have to struggle with basic literacy skills, lessons of safe sex and teen pregnancy, lessons on superiority of altruism over egoism, the difference between wise and not-so-wise choices, existential questions, etc. Although constant reeducation may contribute to gaining a fresh perspective in each generation, it is also painfully wasteful. As yet, there is no efficient remedy to the death of knowledge. All we can do is to attach more weight to healthy lifestyle and health research. Those two promote longevity of knowledge in a single generation. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Knowledge_and_forgetting class=mw-headline>Knowledge and forgetting</SPAN></H3>
<P>Forgetting is a natural process that makes it possible to efficiently use the limited memory space of the brain. We forget to dispose of knowledge deemed less important in order to make space for knowledge of higher importance. Currently we have only a limited control over what we remember and what we forget. Today, the most important tool that we can use to prevent forgetting is practice. We can minimize time needed for practice by using <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="729">spaced repetition</A> (i.e. learning technique based on computing optimum <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="730">intervals</A> between repetitions). <B>Spaced repetition is the key to maximizing knowledge within a single human lifetime</B>. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Immortal_knowledge class=mw-headline>Immortal knowledge</SPAN></H3>
<P>Artificial intelligence is our best hope for approaching immortal knowledge. It can nearly eliminate the problem of death (except for the heat death of the universe or factors that we cannot foresee today, e.g. the collapse of space, and the like). Artificial intelligence can also eliminate the problem of forgetting (at least within the bounds of the available storage). Some forgetting is needed to shape crisp associative knowledge, but that is a welcome phenomenon that leads to more applicable knowledge. Despite great hopes we might have about artificial intelligence, the best path towards immortal knowledge must still rely today on the use of the human brain. This is why we believe that incremental learning is so vital for further human progress. </P>

Is incremental reading an attack on traditional books? If you read in pieces and with endless interruption, does it not destroy the storyline? </P>
<P>Whether <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="732">incremental reading</A> is a curse or a blessing depends on the way it is employed. There is no sharp transition between traditional reading and incremental reading. In the simplest case, you can use <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="733">incremental reading</A> exactly in the same way as you would read a book. Partitioning of texts and interruptions are not compulsory. You can read the entire text from top to the bottom without a single interruption. This would make sense if you needed a storyline for context, and did not want to bother with committing it to long-term memory. If you do take breaks or skip portions of texts or change the natural sequence of reading, it all happens in situations that have their counterparts in the world of books: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Interruptions</B>: you can read an entire book in a single evening, but very often you take breaks and read a book in portions on a daily basis. You may even put it back on a shelf in a busy period and return after a few weeks 
<LI><B>Multiple subjects</B>: it is not unusual to read more than one book in parallel. You may pick one that matches your mood for a given evening, or read portions of different books on the same day 
<LI><B>Changing the sequence of reading</B>: many readers are tempted to peek at the end of the book for its ending. Or browse back to earlier chapters to check some details that failed to register in prior reading 
<LI><B>Deleting portions of the book</B>: deleting portions of the text in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="734">incremental reading</A> is analogous to dropping them from your memory through forgetting once you read a book. The book is still on the shelf, the original electronic article may still exist in your archive, but your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="735">collection</A> or your memory retain only highlights that may get sparser as weeks go by. Years after the original reading you may retain only single quotes or golden thoughts. The rest is gone</LI></UL>
<P>In other words, in extreme cases, there may be no difference between traditional and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="736">incremental reading</A>. Gutenberg's blessing is safe. If you believe interruptions or multiplicity of subjects are beneficial, you can employ them at greater ease that it is the case with book reading. At the other extreme, you may wish to take on thousands of independent articles, make interruptions a norm, focus your reading only on portions that you deem most important, etc. </P>
<P>A rule of the thumb is: use traditional reading when you read stories or you read for enjoyment. Use <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="737">incremental reading</A> to process learning material, textbooks, notes, or scientific literature that you need to remember for life (or at least for many months). </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Knowledge_acquisition:_Areas_of_optimization class=mw-headline>Knowledge acquisition: Areas of optimization</SPAN></H2>
<P>There are seven main areas where the learning process can be enhanced. Incremental learning plays a role in each, however, the first two areas will benefit only through your growing experience, and ability to quantify your progress: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>access to knowledge</B>: with the advent of the world wide web, we all have information literally at our fingertips. Searching for knowledge with <A class="external text" href="http://google.com">Google</A> is fast, easy and accurate. <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> is the biggest encyclopedia in human history. Access to knowledge is no longer a bottleneck of human learning. It virtually became a non issue! Web's quality and role will continue increasing exponentially as more and more people appreciate its potential and contribute to its growth. There are still many complementary sources of information that compete successfully with the Internet. However, it is only a question of time before you will be safely able to rely on the Internet as your sole source of information. The great benefit of reading the web, as opposed to reading the books, is that the hypertext nature of the web enforces a very compact and usually self-explaining nature of individual articles. A jump to a randomly selected page in an average book will leave you confused due to the context-dependence of the material. On the other hand, it is less likely the same confusion will trouble you in a random jump to a selected page of an equivalent material placed on the web. Web authors usually put more effort to add contexts to the page (at least in the form of hyperlinks). In other words, it is easier to build quality knowledge by reading single pages of the web than by reading single pages of paper books. We are getting closer to the ideals of incremental life-long learning as opposed to thorough-review learning which for many ends with the end of school years. In the busy days of modern society, few can afford a thorough review of their rusty knowledge in individual fields. It is much easier to fix the gaps incrementally: today an article on the structure of the atom, tomorrow an article on a healthy diet, etc. And all that strictly adjusted to individual's interests and professional priorities 
<LI><B>selecting knowledge</B>: you will face the need to fill the gaps in your knowledge in many more areas than your time permits or your memory makes possible. You can ask SuperMemo to help you scrupulously note down and prioritize all areas of knowledge that need an enhancement! In SuperMemo, you are the master of what you learn and what you neglect. Your ability to select valuable information will grow in proportion to the acquired knowledge. Incremental learning helps you quantify your knowledge and extrapolate into the future. This will help you be more selective in choosing your learning materials. 
<LI><B>reading</B>: this is the first stage where knowledge makes an actual intimate contact with the brain. Traditionally, it is streamed into memory in a more or less linear manner (i.e. paragraph after paragraph). Incremental learning helps you delinearize this process and optimize reading by enhancing <B>knowledge selection and prioritization</B> concurrently with reading. For example, you should be able to say "<I>This paragraph can be processed later</I>" or "<I>This paragraph requires utmost attention right now</I>" or "<I>This paragraph can be skipped for good even if I decide to read the article again</I>" or "<I>I want to read this paragraph again in three days and in more detail</I>" or "<I>I want to mark this paragraph with lower priority and come to it only after all higher priority paragraphs have been processed</I>", etc. 
<LI><B>representing knowledge</B>: the way in which you present knowledge will affect comprehension and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="738">retention</A> (i.e. how well you remember). Things that are simple are easier to understand. Things that are simple are also easier to remember. Many people do not realize the degree to which simplicity can affect learning. Many people doubt that even the most complex material can be presented in a very simple way. Einstein noticed that "<I>it should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid</I>" 
<LI><B>remembering knowledge</B>: SuperMemo helps you eliminate the problem of forgetting. You will base all learning on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="739">spaced repetition</A> that SuperMemo pioneered almost 30 years ago. SuperMemo produces immense savings in time by scheduling review of the studied material only then when the review is necessary (see: <A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">Introduction to SuperMemo</A>) 
<LI><B>life cycle of knowledge</B>: knowledge in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="740">collection</A> and in your memory keeps on evolving and maturing. This will involve continual rewording, reprioritizing, and re-associating pieces of knowledge. You will often give up portions of knowledge that become outdated or lose their high-priority status. You will apply the rules of knowledge representation that will make knowledge easy to remember. Your knowledge will also become more associative in time. In other words, it will become a more suitable ground for making intelligent choices 
<LI><B>using knowledge</B>: knowledge translates to value when it is properly used. In the long-run, skills discussed in this article will indirectly help you become more creative and skillful in using your own knowledge. Not surprisingly, your skills needed to efficiently use knowledge are also part of knowledge itself and tend to grow spontaneously as your knowledge increases</LI></OL>
<H2><SPAN id=Cost-Benefit_Analysis class=mw-headline>Cost-Benefit Analysis</SPAN></H2>
<H3><SPAN id=Cost_of_knowledge class=mw-headline>Cost of knowledge</SPAN></H3>
<P>Each piece of knowledge stored in SuperMemo adds to the total cost of learning in terms of time. If knowledge is <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">well-formulated</A>, we can estimate that a single element will be repeated from 8-20 times in a lifetime. If a single repetition time falls in the range from 3 seconds to 15 seconds, we could conclude that the expected lifetime cost of a single item ranges from 24 seconds to 5 minutes. SuperMemo has a statistical measure called <B><A title=Statistics href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Statistics#Cost">Cost</A></B>. It measures the total time cost of a single memorized element. In a well-managed long-term learning process, this cost is usually estimated at 2-3 minutes/item in a 10-year bracket. This is then more than the theoretical prediction due to the fact that each collection contains a small subset of so-called <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Leech" oldtitle="Glossary:Leech" data-hasqtip="741">leeches</A> which dramatically increase the average cost/item (note that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Leech" oldtitle="Glossary:Leech" data-hasqtip="742">leeches</A> can easily be <A title=Leeches href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Leeches">detected and removed</A> from the learning process). The rational criterion for deciding if a piece of knowledge should be memorized by means of SuperMemo is to judge the benefits of having the given piece constantly available in memory. If the benefits do not seem to add up to more than 10 minutes, the student might simply not add an item to SuperMemo. With a dose of practice, this analysis becomes a semi-automatic process, and should painlessly blend with your life </P>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
<P>The cost-benefit criterion is: <B>if costs of not knowing a piece of knowledge is greater than the cost of repetitions in a given period of time, add this piece of knowledge to SuperMemo</B> (otherwise do not add it, or relegate it to lower priority). </P></DIV>
<H3><SPAN id=Cost_of_items class=mw-headline>Cost of items</SPAN></H3>
<P>Cost of a single <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">well-structured</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="743">item</A> in lifetime ranges roughly from 24 seconds to 5 minutes. At any given moment it may be approximated for a 30-year bracket, by multiplying <B><A title="Element data" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_data#Repetitions">Repetitions</A>&nbsp;: Future</B> (in <A title="Element data" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_data"><B>Element data</B> window</A>) by <B>Avg time</B> (in <A title=Statistics href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Statistics">learning statistics</A>). SuperMemo displays this value in the <A title="Element data" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_data"><B>Element data</B> window</A>. If your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="744">item</A> is ill-structured (i.e. difficult to remember), this cost may bloat!

<H3><SPAN id=Benefit class=mw-headline>Benefit</SPAN></H3>
<P>Each piece of knowledge in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="746">collections</A> should be associated with a tangible benefit. Only <B>you</B> can accurately guess the value. For example, the value of memorizing the opening hours of your gym in a given time might be approximated by multiplying (1) the probability you will choose wrong hours by (2) the time-cost of missing the gym. For example, if you believe that the probability is 25% and the cost of choosing wrong hours is 40 minutes, the cost of knowing the opening hours is around 10 minutes. In such a case, memorizing the opening hours will be cheaper than missing the gym. However, if the probability is sufficiently low or the time loss sufficiently small, you should not add opening hours to SuperMemo. For example, if the probability is 10% and time loss is 3 minutes, you are not likely to recover your learning investment! There are naturally less clear-cut cases in-between. If you are not sure if you should add a piece of knowledge to SuperMemo, add it with sufficiently low <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="747">priority</A>. With overflow tools (e.g. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-postpone" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-postpone" data-hasqtip="748">auto-postpone</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Auto-sort" oldtitle="Glossary:Auto-sort" data-hasqtip="749">auto-sort</A>, etc.), you can drag along less valuable pieces of knowledge at little cost. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Priorities class=mw-headline>Priorities</SPAN></H3>
<P>You will quickly realize that there are awfully many pieces of information that pass the cost-benefit criterion. You cannot ever hope to learn all this information. This is actually optimistic. This means that with a good selection of knowledge, you can gain far more than just a few minutes on memorizing the gym hours. You may gain untold hours by learning things that transform your life.

<P>You must have heard it from your parents or teachers that "<I>Readers are leaders</I>". <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_truman">Harry Truman</A> added a pessimistic twist to that claim: "<I>Not every reader is a leader, but every leader is a reader</I>". That qualification tells you that reading is not a panacea, and that making reading smart is vital. With the advent of the web, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>, blogosphere, and other sources of knowledge, access to information is easier than ever. This also means that information becomes more overwhelming. There are always too many things to read. And it is hard to select from a myriad of essential sources. This is no longer a world with a hundred books of which you needed to pick five. Now you literally have thousands of menu options for a single meal. Old bookworm dilemmas are now even more painful. Search the web for solutions for book selection, and you will literally find dozens of blogs with advice. However, most of the advice is based on volatile skills that are hard to master. You need to become an expert in book selection, in speed-reading, in skimming, in skim-or-read decisions, in highlight-and-review strategies, in margin notes and in underlines. For traditional massive reading mastery (without SuperMemo), you would need to go for the extreme: reading in the toilet, reading on the train, reading on your mobile phone, making use of your dead time, etc. You would need to ruthlessly control your emotions with "not to read" decisions, or "not to finish" decisions, or "not to re-read" decisions, etc. </P>
<P>If you master incremental learning, you will not solve the problem of information overload. However, you will systematically address all issues that pester massive readers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>I believe that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="760">incremental reading</A> (IR) may slow down or hamper learning complex subjects that require deeper understanding -- as opposed to superficial remembering. From what I'm told, in IR, the student spends but a few seconds on a passage related to one subject, and then jumps to another, completely unrelated subject. Such switching among disparate subjects makes it difficult, if not impossible, to engage in deeper thoughts and thus to discover deeper truths beyond the superficial remembering of passages. When I read, I look for concepts and methods that underlie the necessarily descriptive language used to convey them, and I try to imagine their applicability in my other pursuits. In other words, discovering deeper truths requires deeper thoughts. The latter are difficult to reach if only a few seconds are spent on a subject at a time. As a practical aside, technical papers in hard sciences and engineering are peppered with notational inconsistencies among different authors, different research groups, and different journals. The same symbols may mean different things in different scientific papers. Similarly, different authors may use different symbols to denote the same quantity. Sometimes the differences are gross and easy to spot, and sometimes they are only subtle. When reading one paper at a time, the reader familiarizes him/herself with the terminology and notation, and can follow the line of reasoning while recognizing the subtleties. Having a few dozen (or hundreds!) articles read in parallel, frequently switching among them, creates a nightmare scenario of confusion where the meaning is lost in the jungle of various notations and subtle terminology differences. This makes it impossible to follow the line of reasoning in any one of the papers. Below are a couple of (imperfect) metaphors that may convey the sense of loss when trying to apply IR to learning complex subjects and to discovering deeper truths:</I> </P>
<OL>
<LI><I>If you are a wine connoisseur, imagine that you are only allowed to smell the wine, but that you are not allowed to drink it, or even to put it in your mouth. How good would your knowledge of wine be? With practice, you would probably learn to distinguish various wineries, age, etc. You may even be more efficient at it, and be able to do it in record time. Yet, I venture a guess that you would feel something missing, that you would feel somehow cheated, that you would feel that you don't know all that there is to know about wine. And rightfully so. Same with IR. You just 'smell' the knowledge, but you never 'taste' it. It may be enough if your goal is to learn a foreign language. But some areas require that you dig deeper if you want the real insight, the real truth.</I> 
<LI><I>Physical exercise. A well-rounded routine has both cardiovascular and resistance training elements to it. IR is like having only the high-intensity cardio. Sure, if you stick with cardio, after a while you will be able to deliver a small package across town in record time -- and that may be all you aspire to. However, it will not give you the upper body strength to help move a 400-kg optics bench. Same with IR: you may impress your audience with the breadth of your knowledge, but you will have to leave the heavy intellectual lifting to others.</I></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The above reasoning can easily be proven false. We can imagine two extremes: </P>
<UL>
<LI>all learning is done using traditional textbook processing with all the academic arsenal of teachers, practise, reasoning, interaction, labwork, and more 
<LI>all learning is purely incremental with no breaks for free thought, calculations on the margin, walking around, conversation, etc.</LI></UL>
<P>It is easy to show that both are flawed. For example, traditional learning is deprived of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="761">spaced repetition</A>, while pure incremental learning may be seen as deprived of conversation or lab practise. Clearly, the optimum falls somewhere in the mix between the two extremes. <B>Incremental learning is a supplementary tool in well-rounded education</B>. It is not supposed to monopolize your day and your thinking. It should not be seen as a replacement, but as an enhancement. As such, it is up to you to find your optimum. </P>
<P><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="762">Incremental reading</A> is all you want it to be. It can be speed-reading, cram-reading, or mass-reading. It all depends on the priority criteria which you choose. For that reasons, it would be best described as a reading management technique. As such it is indispensable independent of the complexity of the studied matter. On one hand, you can speed-read articles faster than in conventional speed-reading and yet leave vital paragraphs for future review. On the other hand, you can meticulously dismantle individual paragraphs and convert them into classical questions-answers material that will stay with you for ever. In addition, you can freely manipulate the volume of the material flowing into the reading/learning process. You can focus on a hundred most important articles or you can opt for thousands. Naturally, in the latter case, your time allocation for individual articles will be minute. For example, if you import 10,000 articles to SuperMemo, you might end up with 50,000 to 100,000 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="763">extracts</A> within a year of 1-hour daily reading. In such circumstances, low priority articles will indeed linger for months in the process. Naturally, this is exactly the purpose of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="764">incremental reading</A>: focus on what is important without neglecting anything that falls within your area of interest. If your focus changes, you can use search and navigation tools to speed up the review of most important portions of your reading material. </P>
<P><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="765">Incremental reading</A> is universal in textbook learning. Whatever complex concepts you need to analyze, and whatever computations you need to make on the margins, you can do in parallel with incremental reading of the textbook (assuming you have an electronic version). An old rule says: whatever you need to remember for life (or at least months), process incrementally (to improve memory, boost understanding, and save time in the long term). Whatever you need at the moment, for the sake of understanding the subject, process in bulk (non-incrementally). By combining the two, you can get the most of your learning. </P>
<P>Metaphorically, a pencil is a useful tool that can enhance your life. You will not want to replace your computer with a pencil, or use a pencil while cooking.

<LI>It is conceivable that an incremental reading novice would suffer from the lack of knowledge of the toolset and get lost in the process thus making it more confusing than it is the case with standard textbook learning. Weighing up pros and cons should always consider an ideal case in which the student truly understands the methods of incremental learning. This often takes months of use.

<LI>Some research papers are less suitable for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="769">incremental reading</A>.

<LI>For novices, knowledge acquired with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="771">incremental reading</A> may not taste as sweet as for a professional.

<P style="COLOR: rgb(0,0,255)"><I>The Earth is moving very very slowly away from the Sun. This happens for two reasons. The first is that the Sun is constantly losing mass because of the solar wind. As the mass of the Sun decreases its pull on the Earth decreases and so the Earth moves slightly further away. The second reason is to do with tidal forces. In exactly the same way that the Moon is slowly moving away from the Earth, the Earth is very slowly moving away from the Sun. In the Earth-Moon case the Moon pulls on the Earth creating tides and slowing the Earth&#8217;s rotation very slightly, making the day longer. This action has a reaction - the Moon's orbit is speeded up. If something travels faster it must move outwards to remain in an orbit and so the Moon slowly drifts away from us at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. The same situation happens with the Sun but the Earth&#8217;s influence on the Sun is much smaller than the Moon&#8217;s influence on the Earth. The result is the Earth&#8217;s tiny tiny drift away from the Sun</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As an incremental reader, you might gradually develop a dislike of old-style books (as opposed to importable e-books and articles).

<P>If you give incremental learning a more determined try, you will understand that the opposite is true: <B>perfectionists should love incremental learning</B>! Your perfectionist nature should accept the overriding rule: maximum quality knowledge in minimum time. It is not the beauty of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="795">clozes</A> in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="796">collection</A> that counts, but the beauty of knowledge in your mind.

In such circumstances, perfecting the formulation of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="800">cloze</A> will become art for art's stake.

<P>The existence of the memory bottleneck is the direct consequence of the overload concern. You can overload your learning process with excess information, however, you are unlikely to "overload your long-term memory". The processes of forgetting and garbage collection executed in sleep have evolved precisely to prevent this problem. However much you try to learn excess facts, forgetting will clean up the excess, and memory optimization in sleep will ensure you develop all necessary "meaningful connections". Naturally, this will happen only if you get all sleep that you need (i.e. avoid using alarm clock, sleeping pills, staying up late, etc.). </P>

<P><I>A friend recommended <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="821">incremental reading</A> to me. However, I was instantly turned off by your claim: read thousands of articles at the same time. This is not only impossible, but also sounds like overhyped marketing. All you do in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="822">incremental reading</A> is split articles into chunks and read those separately. With this method you lose the big picture. I am afraid you are selling snake oil</I>. </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That skepticism is understandable, and yet we stick with the original claim: you can indeed read thousands of articles at the same time. This is because <I>reading</I> can be understood as a <I>process</I> or as an <I>act</I>. No one can make a sane claim of multiple reading acts at the same time. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="823">incremental reading</A>, only one article receives a laser focus at any given moment of time. Few students read more than 50 articles in a single day, and they rarely read them all in their entirety. However, they may easily read or skim a few thousand articles in a month, and keep hundreds of thousands of articles in the incremental learning <I>process</I>. In that sense <I>reading thousands of articles at the same time</I> is an accurate if somewhat enticing description. </P>
<P>To understand <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="824">incremental reading</A>, you need to understand SuperMemo (or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Repetition_spacing" oldtitle="Glossary:Repetition spacing" data-hasqtip="825">repetition spacing</A> in general), as well as the effects of intermittent reading on memory. Reading in chunks without the help of the underlying learning process based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="826">spaced repetition</A> indeed makes little sense. However, once you master and understand the techniques of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="827">incremental reading</A>, you will get the effect opposite to the one expected: not only will you not lose the track of the big picture, you will keep a lasting, durable and coherent memory image of whatever you found important in the processed articles. </P>

<H2><SPAN id=Incremental_reading_vs._memory_interference class=mw-headline>Incremental reading vs. memory interference</SPAN></H2>
<P>You may have read about interference in learning. When students learn two things one after another, they perform worse than in cases where they focus on one thing. This might sound like a reason to disqualify <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="828">incremental reading</A> as an effective learning method. </P>
<P>It is true that interference can ruin learning. If you read about a subject without fully understanding it and follow it with another subject that is confusingly similar in nature, you will indeed perform worse in tests. However, this effect is much less pronounced if the first subject is studied with solid comprehension. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="829">Incremental reading</A> makes it possible to read only as much as you understand. Then it encourages long-term <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="830">retention</A> by producing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="831">cloze deletions</A>. Finally, it periodically rediscovers weaknesses in the learning process and fills the gap. When well executed, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="832">incremental reading</A> produces an opposite effect. It minimizes interference by forcing you to resolve contradiction in your material. It ruthlessly punishes all cases of incomplete understanding. In classroom conditions, you can get a foggy pass at subject A, then worsen the fog by digging into subject B. In <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="833">incremental reading</A>, SuperMemo will force you to jump from A to B and back to A until the two form a harmonious body of knowledge with minimum interference and maximum connectivity. Note that the same research on interference produces diametrically different results when the interfering <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="834">topics</A> are subject to continual re-reading.

The outcome of the experiment may also be obscured by adding a degree of novelty to old reviews which greatly improves attention. Better learning follows in the wake. </P>

<P><I>In addition to the behavioral and physiological criteria already mentioned, subjective experience (in the case of the self) and verbal reports of such experience (in the case of others) are used at the human level to define sleep. Upon being alerted, one may feel or say, "I was asleep just then," and such judgments ordinarily are accepted as evidence for identifying a prearousal state as sleep. Such subjective evidence, however, can be at variance with both behavioral classifications and sleep electrophysiology, raising interesting questions about how to define the true measure of sleep. Is sleep determined by objective or subjective evidence alone, or is it determined by some combination of the two? And what is the best way to measure such evidence? More generally, problems in defining sleep arise when evidence for one or more of the several criteria of sleep is lacking or when the evidence generated by available criteria is inconsistent.

<P>Donald Rumsfeld claims to live by the rule: "<I>First reports are always wrong</I>". </P>
<P>News carries knowledge that is usually valid in a short term only. Incremental learning is useful only for long-term memories. The greatest benefits of trying to process news with incremental learning is to realize how transient news is, and to moderate the craving for news by making it "old news" through the incremental approach. </P>
<P>These are the main reasons why news is a poor candidate for your learning material: </P>
<UL>
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is incomplete. If you hear "breaking news", you know this is about news that is "broken". It is incomplete and inaccurate. If you ever think of retaining it in your memory for long, come back to <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> in a week, or in a month, or in a few years. The news becomes most useful when it becomes history. Most of the time, however, it all gets forgotten by the next "news cycle" 
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is contradictory. If you happen to incrementally juxtapose news with old news, you will realize the extent to which people change their minds as new information becomes available. That evolution in thinking and opinion is probably the most interesting part of news. 
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is scant. What was news yesterday might still be news today with some tiny change in the angle. News is repetitive and monopolized by single "hot" issue. If you watch news once a week, you will rarely miss anything important for your long-term perspective 
<LI>knowledge that comes with the news is trivial. Breaking news might be devoted entirely to a plane crash, or a bomb explosion. Unless you or your close ones are directly affected, you hardly ever become a better person by being intimate with the details of the tragedy. Understanding plane crashes or bomb explosions in general is far more relevant. A National Geographic documentary might be a better source of such knowledge. Unless this is your first ever encounter with crashes and bombs, you rarely learn anything of major significance. Your ability to change the world will better be enhanced with other sources of knowledge. Your optimization in this area will also help build a future with fewer bombs and fewer crashes.</LI></UL>
<P>News may have more value for you at younger ages when you still need to learn a lot about the world, or when you are trying to learn a new language and want to understand the news broadcast from another country. In such cases, use news mostly as the source of indications of what supplementary material should enter your learning process for you to comprehend the news better. </P>
<P>Unless you study journalism (and need to understand the process), or political sciences (incl. the impact of news on the public), or you just live and die by being up-to-date, you should limit your craving for news and focus on knowledge with long-term applicability. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Example:_how_breaking_news_breaks_the_news class=mw-headline>Example: how breaking news breaks the news</SPAN></H3>
<P>Consider this funny episode from CNN that illustrates the obsession with "breaking news". On a sunny Sunday of September 22, 2013, Fareed Zakaria spoke about Angela's Merkel impact on Germany, and Europe: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Merkel has taken important steps to help Europe's struggling economies, spending tens of billions of dollars directly and indirectly on them. On the other hand, Merkel has imposed austerity on much of Europe, which has been excessive and counterproductive. Her argument is that it is the only way to get governments like Greece and Italy to become more competitive. Now here's the irony...</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now here is a real irony. The intelligent commentary was interrupted by the breaking news related to Angela Merkel herself. The viewer did not get a chance to learn about the historic role of the German leader. Instead he or she got a 2 min. "deal" to watch Angela Merkel vote in a federal election. Three full minutes of relaxing silence and a chance to admire Angela's dress and body language in this historic moment. </P>
<P>Ah yes, if you cannot stand similar interruptions and want to learn about the historic role of Angela, see Zakaria's transcripts at <A class="external text" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1309/22/fzgps.01.html">FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Not the Time for Big Sticks; Interview with Bill Clinton; Will Germany's Merkel Practice What She Preaches?</A> </P>

<P><B>Question</B>: What was decided at the Council of Trent, beginning in 1545, and how long did the Council go on?<BR><B>Answer</B>: The basic beliefs of the Catholic Church; 18 years. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Two separate memories should be separated in SuperMemo due to the fact that they nearly always will require different timing of repetitions. If you can always activate the same mental pathway in thinking about the Council of Trent ("neurons firing together" in the same pattern), your particular <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="850">item</A> has a good chance of surviving long in the process without a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="851">memory lapse</A>. However, once you build a large database of similar <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="852">items</A>, and you review your sizeable material under the pressure of time, your review will always tend to strip redundant pieces of information. Overtime, your nice <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="853">item</A> will be reduced to the bare bones of information that will often fail its primary test: applicability in real life. It may happen, that despite zero <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="854">memory lapses</A>, in 2-3 years, someone will ask you about a Council of Trent in a new context and you will be amazed that you won't be able to reasonably answer the question despite having all the necessary pieces of information included in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="855">item</A>. Two memories of different difficulty might be compared to two different planes of different flying characteristics. The difficult piece (e.g. 18 year duration of the Council) might be compared to a slow flying plane. The easy piece (here the reference to the Catholic Church) might be compared to a modern jet. Review of the conglomerated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="856">item</A> might be compared to flying both planes at the same speed. In an extreme case, this might be impossible. The compromise speed might be too high for a slow plane, which might disintegrate beyond a certain speed limit, while the faster plane cannot slow down enough without stalling. In our memory, forgetting is equivalent to forgetting, while stalling is caused by the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="857">spacing effect</A>. By doing complex and repeatable reasoning at each repetition, you might act as if handling both planes using remote control. However, this is always difficult and requires lots of focus and deliberation at repetitions. Your brain has natural defenses against such "enforced repetitive reasoning". It is designed to be "intellectually lazy" and thus energetically efficient. Practice shows that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="858">incremental reading</A> produces many more <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="859">items</A>. However, those <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="860">items</A> are usually much easier to remember. In the end, you spend less time on reviewing 5-10 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="861">items</A> than you would spend on an item that would conglomerate information and suffer repeated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="862">memory lapses</A> or very short <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="863">intervals</A>. </P>
<P>In the course of the evolution, the brain developed strategies for abstracting away from the details and retaining only the most essential, useful and frequently used information. Those strategies are great for survival, but aren't as good in reaching our educational goals. Council of Trent is a typical example of knowledge we wish to have, but that is pretty expensive. This is because, for most people, it does not get reinforced in run-of-the-mill conversations, TV shows, daily applicability, or at water cooler at work. The situation might differ if you, in particular, read a lot on the subject matter. This might help the memory establish itself in an efficient manner. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="864">Incremental reading</A> makes it possible to root such difficult-to-retain knowledge firmly in the context, and still make sure that individual repetitions focus on a very specific and cheap-to-retain memories. </P>

<P>Antioxidants may slow aging process, study says April 5, 1999 Web posted at: 9:39 p.m. EDT (0139 GMT) From Correspondent Linda Ciampa -- Research at Tufts University indicates that a healthy diet fortified with certain fruits and vegetables may slow down and even reverse the aging process. Foods rich in antioxidants -- such as blueberries, strawberries, spinach and broccoli -- have what doctors call high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity) levels. Middle-aged rats who were fed a high ORAC diet in the USDA-sponsored study experienced less memory loss than those given a normal diet. Some of the older, slower rats became as lively as their younger peers after taking antioxidants. "We prevented both some brain and some behavioral changes that one normally sees in these rats when they hit 15 months of age," said USDA researcher Jim Joseph. Antioxidants are effective in destroying free radicals -- cell-damaging compounds that can help cause cancer and heart disease and speed the aging process. "It's pretty well accepted that aging is due to the production of free radicals. So anything we can do nutritionally to provide additional antioxidants is likely to protect us in the process of aging," Joseph said. That fact already has prompted many to eat a diet rich in antioxidants. "I look at it as sort of a savings account. I'm benefiting today from eating right, but I'm also going to have it in the future," said 30-year-old Cori Alcock. "As I age and grow older, I'll have good health as well." </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease, even after being passed through a porcelain filter known to retain all bacteria, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants.</I></P>
<P><I>In 1900 a similarly filterable agent was reported for foot-and-mouth disease of cattle.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Before you begin learning, you can save lots of time by looking for articles that are properly structured and written in a concise language that will help you save lots of time. For example, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> is an excellent source. As it is edited by many people in an incremental manner, it is highly context-independent. In comparison, <A class="external text" href="http://britannica.com">Britannica</A> is wordy, full of pronouns, definite clauses, and various context references. </P>
<P>Where <A class="external text" href="http://britannica.com">Britannica</A> might say (fictitious example): "<I>Over the next five years, he struggled to obtain a patent for his invention</I>", <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> might say explicitly "<I>In the years 1883-1889, Edison struggled to obtain a patent for a filament of carbon of high resistance</I>". This context-independent style can save you hours of parsing and re-editing. </P>
<P>In the presented example, the first sentence is causing trouble because the author tried to tell you far more than you might wish to process in one go. </P>
<P>One strategy is to start with monster <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="914">clozes</A>, and simplify them incrementally while learning. However, you could save lots of time with another strategy, in which you split the sentences into more manageable portions. Unfortunately, in this case, some editing will be necessary in the beginning. You will also need to carefully parse the meaning of the passage. You could, for example, separate <I>who</I> and <I>what</I> components of the sentence </P>

Once all paragraphs in the parent article are processed, you will terminate the review of the parent article and keep on reviewing only its components (e.g. selected paragraphs) 
<LI>Upon the first review, usually after a few days, you read the extracted paragraph again and analyze it as to how it should be processed further. You may decide to <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">postpone</A> it, remove it from the learning process, shorten it or extract the most important sentences that you want to remember 
<LI>If you decide to extract a single statement in reference to <I>Kuznets hypothesis</I> it will again be marked as <SPAN class=extract>processed</SPAN> in the original <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="926">extract</A> and will assume a separate review cycle in SuperMemo 
<LI>Upon the first review of the extracted sentence, you make further decisions as to its further life in SuperMemo. Let us say, this is the wording of the Kuznets sentence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth (from the low income levels associated with predominantly agrarian societies) would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>In order to capture the essence, you would probably decide to shorten the above sentence to the following form: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>At the same time, other parts of the same parent article might establish a memory trace that would say that <I>Kuznets hypothesis</I> has been based on relatively weak empirical data. Moreover, recent research clearly indicates that the hypothesis is false (growth actually seems to equally benefit both the poor and the rich). You could then enhance the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="927">extract</A> with words <I>controversial</I> or even <I>recently falsified</I>. For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Recently falsified Kuznets hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Upon the next review of the same sentence, you may decide to convert it into a number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="928">cloze deletions</A>. This conversion will be incremental, i.e. you may decide to first create a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="929">cloze deletion</A> asking about the name of the controversial hypothesis and only later ask about its actual meaning (the meaning is relatively easier to remember and shall survive longer in your memory without <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall" oldtitle="Glossary:Active recall" data-hasqtip="930">active recall</A>). Your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="931">cloze deletion</A> could then look like this:

<P>This <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="932">cloze deletion</A> would again assume a separate life from the original sentence in which the keyword <I>Kuznets</I> will again be marked as <SPAN class=clozed>processed</SPAN>. This is the original Kuznets sentence with one keyword marked as processed: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Recently falsified <SPAN class=clozed>Kuznets</SPAN> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>The same sentence will generate a few separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="933">cloze deletions</A> that will be processed independently.

<P>With some experience, you will quickly notice that the problem resides in the poor quality of the chosen text. Your first red flag should come with "<I>companies or other groups</I>". Unless you are an insider to the subject, you will instantly wonder what "<I>other groups</I>" means. If you look at the essence of your question, you will notice that "<I>other groups</I>" does not add to the core of the question and can easily be skipped. After some analysis, you can make an effort to formulate a straightforward question, however, it is easier and more cost-effective to take an incremental approach (as long as you keep understanding the question, which may not be the case with you). </P>
<P>As soon as you notice that "<I>other groups</I>" are out of place, you can simplify the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="947">cloze</A>: </P>

<P>You may also notice that <I>allowances</I> and <I>credits</I> are synonymous (acc. to that particular question), and you may not need to tax your memory with both terms. You can therefore make the question easier: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: Companies are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> which represent the right to emit a specific amount<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances/credits </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>During the next repetition you may wish to simplify the question further. You can now start feeling confident that the question will stick to your memory. If that makes you feel better, you will have made a big step towards better recall:</P>
<P class=mw-empty-elt></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: Companies hold a number of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> which represent the right to emit a specific amount<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances/credits (emission permits) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Some time in the future, you might take yet another incremental step: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> represent the right to emit a specific amount (by companies)<BR><B>Answer</B>: allowances/credits (emission permits) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finally, you may realize that you question is actually a definition of a term (<I>credit/allowance</I>). As such, it does not even need the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="948">cloze</A>. You may also notice that the definition misses an important context point. The original question spoke of carbon emissions (which is probably indicated by the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> references that provide the context of the question). </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question</B>: (What is the name of) the right to emit a specific amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (by companies)?<BR><B>Answer</B>: (carbon) permits/allowances/credits </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With the above definition, learning should finally be easy and fun. Remember that it is a frequently used standard to separate synonyms or equivalent answers with a slash ("/"). This means that any answer will do <I>permits</I>, <I>allowances</I>, or <I>credits</I>. You do not need to list them all and you do not need to remember about semi-obvious <I>carbon</I> prefix. </P>
<P>Interestingly, it can easily be found that the text comes from May 7, 2010 version of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>.

You may still prefer to read it on paper in a bathtub.

For example, you would not want to memorize the Linux source code.

<P>Here is an example paragraph that caused learning problem to a user of SuperMemo: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>A good enterprise architect should enable the right balance between the needs of the organization for an integrated IT strategy, permitting the closest possible synergy across the extended enterprise, and allowing individual business units to innovate safely in their pursuit of competitive advantage.</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The user wrote: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>I have no problem understanding this phrase (synergy across business units must be balanced against freedom to innovate within business units), and I constructed two <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="953">cloze deletions</A> from it for either side of the balance, and when presented with either question I can fill in the blanks. Yet, I was in a discussion recently defending a synergy position, not realizing that it might jeopardize innovation, not even realizing I had this SuperMemo question pointing it out to me. In other words, even though I can answer the question in SuperMemo, it is not something that stuck in my memory, i.e. the synergy is not associated with freedom-to-innovate and vice versa (maybe it will after this mail). So, I suspect that I am only able to answer the question based on recognition of the question or some such, and not on recognition of the association. I figure that a better way to associate the two would be to ask something like "what must be balanced against each other" but this question would be so general in nature that it would create serious interference with other questions that deal with other aspects of enterprise architecture that need to be balanced against each other. Or I would have to make it more specific, again risking to give away the answer in the question, which would also not cause the association to form.</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Can you identify a problem here? </P>
<P>In similar cases, you need to pause to ponder what kind of questions you want to be able to answer having read the passage. If the questions are too general or too obvious, you just need to trust your own intelligence and creativity to be able to answer them on the basis of your experience and more specific questions in the given area of knowledge. </P>
<P>In this case, keywords such as "synergy" or "innovate" might provide a hazy way to capture the meaning of the passage. However, very general texts are not suitable for treatment with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="954">cloze deletions</A>. You may waste unnecessary time on re-reading the entire passage at question time, or waste time on simplifying the passage to capture the essence. In school jargon, you might call similar passages "waffle". They may carry an important message, they may help the flow of text, they might be explanatory, but they do not yield material suitable for memorization. In the extreme case you can juxtapose Wikipedia-like "IT = Information Technology" with obvious "waffle" that cannot be clozed: <I>We should be nice for other people</I>. </P>
<P>In all sorts of exams, you will always need to tackle lots of "waffle". You will also meet teachers who demand fluent "waffle" performance. However, this is not the type of knowledge that will make you a better expert or a better person. If you meet "waffle", pause to think if there are questions that truly flow from the text, or if the text is too general to be handled with SuperMemo. In your case, you might do better by perhaps adding some meatier passages on enterprise synergy or constraints on innovation or... Actually, you are the best person to find supplementary material that will help you better understand the underlying issues. </P>
<P>If waffle bothers you, try to find a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> equivalent. Due to the nature of crowdsourcing, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> lends itself perfectly to incremental processing. Once you get the hang and feel the benefit, you will quickly learn to spot text and passages that are less suitable and provide less benefit when processed with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="955">incremental reading</A>. </P>

<P><I>Incremental reading is a fairly misunderstood feature of SuperMemo. Incremental reading entails importing your reading material into a flashcard. This can be a huge Wikipedia article for instance, or an entire eBook. Whilst reading, if you encounter a word you&#8217;re unfamiliar with, you can highlight the sentence or paragraph it sits in and make it into an entirely new flashcard automatically, ready for you to review later on. By highlighting, pressing Alt+X to extract the segment &#8211; you will see the section become blue, meaning this part has been extracted to another flashcard. [...] Incremental refers to reading the content in small chunks over time, until you&#8217;ve read all the material and extracted the information you want from it. You can mark where you&#8217;ve reached in the reading material up to using the &#8216;set the read point&#8217; tool on the Read toolbar, so next time you see the article/chapter/whatever, SuperMemo will display it visibly instead of you scrolling down. [...] Once you&#8217;ve finished reading the flashcard, and extracted all of the juicy goodness from it, you can delete it using Shift-Ctrl-Enter. This command is different to pure delete, because it will retain all of the flashcards you created from it, whereas delete will cause you to lose these. Which would be a pain in the derriere. SuperMemo, using it&#8217;s super-duper algorithm, will schedule the review of these items for you. [...] Incremental reading represents a powerful chimera of extensive and intensive reading. And this can be used with anything &#8211; news stories, blog posts, Wikipedia articles.</I> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Here is an exemplary opinion of a user of SuperMemo who understands incremental reading, and still has many reservations: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV class="bs-callout bs-callout-comment">
<P><I>I have been using SuperMemo for 19 years now (with occasional breaks). I understand the concept of incremental reading pretty well. I read about it a lot. Many times I thought of trying it. However, I am still not convinced that I should embark on this journey. Please see my story. I will gladly hear your opinion. Am I mistaken or am I different, you think? Or is the incremental reading picture a bit too rosy?</I> </P>
<P><B>Learned read-only mentality</B> </P>
<P><I>I started making repetitions years back with a goal to improving my English. To do that, I relied on learning with a ready-made Advanced English collection containing 40,000+ words and phrases. The learning material was comprehensive (far exceeding my needs), and the default learning process efficient enough to quickly propel me into good command of the language. Encouraged by the results I kept exploring the program but rarely took advantage of the ever-expanding gamut of SuperMemo's new advanced options. It seemed as if I hadn't really needed them to get the results I wanted (at least in the English language department). All I did was make outstanding repetitions, memorize my daily quota of new words and phrases, and, occasionally, add a piece of vocabulary or grammar which wasn&#8217;t originally in the collection.</I> </P>
<P><B>Incompatibility of my profession with incremental approach</B> </P>
<P><I>As for my other learning needs, they start with my professional life which happens to be computer programming. And it seems like an area of knowledge which is not particularly well-suited for declarative learning. Furthermore, Dr Wozniak himself admits learning materials for programming are not suitable for processing with incremental reading. In other words, I seem to be unable to realize the promise of incremental reading in my life&#8217;s vocation thus leaving me less determined to explore it for other domains.</I> </P>
<P><B>Stress factor</B> </P>
<P><I>I believe that I have achieved a pretty good mastery of SuperMemo over the years. It does not mean though that SuperMemo still isn&#8217;t able to throw a curve ball every now and then. Take the <B>Spread priorities</B> feature for instance. When I first checked it, I was greeted with </I>0!!!<I> against the yellow background in one of the fields: <B>Step</B>. I tried to change the value but no matter what I did I kept coming back to square one. As it turned out, it was SuperMemo&#8217;s way of telling me there aren&#8217;t enough priority positions for the subset I selected. SuperMemo may lack in the implementation department, even though it tries to address this, many times, at great length, in the documentation. In other words, with enough persistence you can find your way around the program. This journey of discovery may be stressful but nowhere near as much as the whole idea of incremental reading if you give it a careful thought. In fact, the more I read about it (at an attempt to dispel my doubts), the more stressful it becomes. Particularly, the entire prioritization stage seems overwhelming (to the point of nausea). The advantages you so diligently describe may all be true (although some are far from obvious and/or instant). Most of those advantage will hold only as long as you set the priorities right. But the entire process seems like a wild goose chase to me (not only because the priority queue is relative in its design). It would be interesting to know how much the student actually spends on priorities in the course of a daily learning session. For example, take a priority scale. In its relative variation (i.e. when expressed as percentage), it ranges from 1 to 100 which is simply too wide (the creators of the ABC analysis recognized that long time ago). I remember reading somewhere SuperMemo novices find it hard to grade yourself on the 6-piece scale. This now seems like a breeze as compared with giving a priority to a piece of knowledge. I understand the intention for more granular control but it is simply mind-boggling. To make matters worse, there are a number of processes (both manual/conscious and (semi-)automatic/unconscious) that erode your painstakingly set priority hierarchy. I do not mind when it actually changes but what if I accidentally stumble against an item whose priority I set as important, it still remains important, but somehow ended up in the later stages of the priority queue (and, from all what I have read, it is more than a remote possibility). When I read the article, I am often reminded of the following quote by Margaret Thatcher: "</I>I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near.<I>" It holds a great promise but it is far from guarantee. I believe, I recognize really well how complex incremental reading actually is, and having that clearly in mind, I conclude your advantages section offers even less in the form of guarantee. You can invest a whole lot of time, and in the end SuperMemo will only make you realize how dismal you are at managing it all (because, make no mistake, </I>you<I> need to carefully manage it). The toolset may be rich but is it natural? Furthermore, it all depends on the correct input. Your advantages include <A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Uniform_progress">uniform progress</A>. Yeah, right. Developing tunnel vision when you import and process a large number of articles related to a single topic is as much if not (considering our human deficiencies) more likely.</I> </P></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

You might just be one of those who excel at theory and fail in practical situations for a number of reasons. You should definitely give incremental learning a try and see how it works. If frustrations keep multiplying beyond the first two months of use, your chances may drop. It is vital to start from simplest concepts: import, extract and cloze. All the remaining tools should wait for their turn until you start enjoying the process. For the same reason, you should start from learning about things you love (not about algebra or economics). Your hobby, your pet, your favorite sport, health, your favorite music band, your favorite actor or actress, etc. Use <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> as its texts are well-suited for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="966">incremental reading</A>.

<UL>
<LI><B>tunnel vision</B>: experience shows that incremental learning favors broad learning as opposed to developing a tunnel vision. After all, the more you know, the more you know you do not know. You are more likely to have your day monopolized by a single topic when you do traditional reading or browsing. In incremental learning you face the whole spectrum of your knowledge (with a natural bias towards your interests). Unpredictability of incremental learning sequences, also in different moods or different contexts (e.g. change of interest), increases the quality of the creative processes. This is where curiosity is born. You are more likely to become interested with a seemingly irrelevant detail when you have a peaceful time allocation typical of incremental learning. This is how you keep branching to new areas. This branching is less likely when you work in conditions of stress, time constraints, and information overload, typical to free browsing on the net. In free browsing, you can open 20 browser tabs and struggle with the right course of action: read now, make favorite, save to disk, skim, give up, etc. In incremental learning, you just import all tabs, and return to your main line of thought. Naturally, it helps greatly if you prioritize the tabs. This is a way of consolidating new interests as opposed to giving them just a temporary brush. SuperMemo's capacity to prevent tunnel vision is mentioned amongst its advantages. See: <B><A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</A>: Uniform progress</B> 
<LI><B>wild goose chase</B>: the way shifting <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="967">priorities</A> work in SuperMemo is exactly how priorities behave in real life situations: your yesterday's interests are ruthlessly replaced by today's interests, and so on. This is a wild goose chase indeed. But the fault is not with SuperMemo, but with human nature. Please recall that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="968">incremental reading</A> started from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Reading_list" oldtitle="Glossary:Reading list" data-hasqtip="969">reading lists</A>. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_bias" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority bias" data-hasqtip="970">Priority bias</A> could result in having a thousand or ten thousand top priority articles. This situation was not manageable and not rational. With relative <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="971">priorities</A> you can observe the process, and work to improve your strategies, and your personal honesty about priorities. This will not stop the wild goose chase, but you have a range of tools to correct your mistakes (e.g. when discovering a neglected portion of the material). However long you think about it, you are not likely to find a better remedy to your knowledge greed than a simple <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="972">priority queue</A>! You have signaled the problem, but you neglect the fact that in real life, the problem is incomparably greater. In SuperMemo, if you discover neglected material, you can up-prioritize it. In traditional learning, you forget the material and the problem itself. It is better to chase the goose that to have it swept under the carpet. 
<LI><B>stress</B>: if the prioritization process is stressful, you can initially ignore the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="973">priority queue</A>. You will needed it only when your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="974">collection</A> grows beyond a manageable size. You can then gradually introduce various prioritization levels. For example, you can have a shy start with just two levels: <I><B>Important: 22%</B></I> and <I><B>Unimportant: 88%</B></I>. You will soon discover that you need more precision, esp. that you will never escape the feeling "<I>this article must land in top 3 articles</I>", which at some point may mean you need decimal places or referencing the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="975">priority queue</A> by position. 
<LI><B>user friendliness</B>: the problem of <B>Step</B> in <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#spread_priorities">Spread priorities</A></B> is typical of SuperMemo, which claims to be unfriendly for novices to better satisfy the pros. This option might display a message: "<I>You are trying to squeeze more <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="976">elements</A> into the range than the size of the range</I>". However, this would make pros apoplectic, as it is very easy to input wrong data. You do not want to waste time on clicking away the message. A pro will just want to correct the input. This problem cannot be remedied by <B><A title="File menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu">File</A>&nbsp;: <A title="File menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File_menu#Level">Level</A></B> because <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#spread_priorities">Spread priorities</A></B> is available only at advanced levels. This means that the user should already be inured to the fact that the first use of any function in SuperMemo may be difficult. A more sophisticated solution, e.g. a wizard or messages incorporated in the dialog, would probably not pass <CODE>Value/Time</CODE> criterion on the ever-bloating SuperMemo tasklist. You are right, SuperMemo is not nice for novices. If you have simpler solution ideas, please mail them. They are always read carefully. 
<LI><B>programming</B>: it is not true that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="977">incremental reading</A> is unsuitable for programmers (for example see: <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/programming.htm">SuperMemo as a new tool for programmers</A>).

The <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="982">priority</A> is determined by the importance of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="983">element</A> for a particular student. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="984">Elements</A> with lower <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="985">priorities</A> will be sacrificed first when the student runs out of learning time on a given day.

<P>During learning, on a given day, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="991">elements</A> with highest <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="992">priorities</A> are processed first. </P>

<P>Early in the learning process, many students do not bother to prioritize their learning material. This attitude is caused by two factors: </P>
<UL>
<LI>smaller volume of memorized material early in the process (and lesser cost of review) 
<LI>false conviction that human memory is vast enough to hold all that dream knowledge</LI></UL>
<P>Do you think you are able to memorize the entire <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</A> line by line, fact for fact? </P>
<P>Chances are your answer might be: <I>"I might be too lazy, I might be too busy, but if I had all the time of my day for the job, I would"</I>. Or perhaps <I>"I might not, but I have heard of geniuses able to do it! How about <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek">Kim Peek</A>?"</I>. If you believe the encyclopedia is within the realm of possible, you will soon realize that you desperately need the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="997">priority queue</A> to help you overcome a big surprise: our memory is far more limited than you think! </P>
<P>Assuming we do not deal with humans affected with a mutation to their memory system, memorizing <A class="external text" href="https://britannica.com">Britannica</A> would falsify the <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm">theory of SuperMemo</A> which should apply to all healthy adults. In the light of SuperMemo, memorizing <A class="external text" href="https://britannica.com">Britannica</A> verges on impossible. There are 44 million words in Britannica's 32 volumes. This translates to 6 million SuperMemo <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="998">items</A> ("human memory bits") assuming the average keyword extraction on information dense texts as 1:7. Assuming a 50-year learning span, we get to 18,250 days and 330 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="999">items</A> per day. Assuming optimum representation of knowledge (say <A class="external text" href="https://britannica.com">Britannica</A> is already "<A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation">perfectly formulated</A>") you cannot learn faster for a given level of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1000">knowledge retention</A> than with SuperMemo (it simply finds the mathematical optimum). Practice shows it is very difficult to sustain more than 100 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1001">items</A> per day in the long run with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1002">retention</A> around 95%. In other words, for an intelligent man, for perfectly formulated Britannica knowledge, with SuperMemo, you are hardly able to accomplish the goal with your whole life devoted to the task! </P>

<P><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1003">Incremental reading</A> makes it easy to import large volumes of learning material from the Internet. By default, all imported material enters the learning process. As a result, large volumes of unprocessed information begin to compete for your attention with most important pieces of knowledge that you decided to remember. It is a clash of priorities. On one hand you want to ensure high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1004">retention</A> of your mission-critical knowledge (as in classical SuperMemo), on the other, you want to devour more and more new knowledge. </P>
<P>Before SuperMemo, your learning would largely be based on reading and reviewing books or your own notes. With older SuperMemos, you would divide your time between reading (on paper) and repetitions (on the computer). With <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1005">incremental reading</A>, those competing processes were blended into one. You can read and review concurrently in SuperMemo. However, for the most avid incremental readers, the balance of priority will always dangerously shift in favor of new reading at the cost of the previously acquired knowledge. This comes from human nature. New reading provides instant gratification: <I>"Today, I have learned something new. I am wiser now"</I>. Reviewing the material you already know will always feel like a burden. We are always unhappy with our forgetful memory. It always feels that the nature should have given us a natural choice of what to forget and what to remember without the painful effort of reviewing what we already know. </P>
<P>To settle the Volume-vs-Retention battle and to resolve the perpetual clash of priorities, you need better weapons than those made available by older SuperMemos. Before the arrival of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1006">priority queue</A> (2006), you would need to use a complex set of tools to employ massive learning and still protect the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1007">retention</A> of your most important knowledge. You would use complex concepts such as <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1008">A-Factors</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Forgetting_index" oldtitle="Glossary:Forgetting index" data-hasqtip="1009">forgetting index</A>, <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning">subset learning</A>, <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">selective postpones</A>, <A title="Browser menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu">repetition sorting</A>, etc. These tools were poorly automated and required substantial effort and knowledge on your part. In practice, most incremental readers would have to opt for the simplest prioritization tool: <I>moderation</I>. You could best protect your previous investment in learning by limiting your hunger for knowledge. </P>
<P>Newer SuperMemos use a simple and fully automated mechanism that will help you combine high volumes of reading with high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1010">retention</A> of the most important material. This mechanism is based on the concept of the <B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1011">priority queue</A></B>. </P>

<P>In SuperMemo, each <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1012">element</A> receives a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1013">priority</A> from <CODE>0%</CODE> to <CODE>100%</CODE>. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1014">Elements</A> sorted by their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1015">priority</A> form the <I><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1016">priority queue</A></I>. An <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1017">element</A>'s <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1018">priority</A> can also be expressed as its position in the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1019">priority queue</A>. The most important <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1020">element</A> in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1021">collection</A> will sit at <CODE>Position=1</CODE> of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1022">priority queue</A>. The queue is a relative queue. This means that if you, for example, insert an important article at <CODE>Position=3</CODE>, all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1023">items</A> and articles at higher positions will be shifted by one position up in the queue (i.e. towards lower <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1024">priority</A>). Thus the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1025">element</A> at <CODE>Position=999</CODE> will be pushed to <CODE>Position=1000</CODE>, while the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1026">element</A> previously sitting at <CODE>Position=3</CODE> will now occupy <CODE>Position=4</CODE>. The first two <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1027">elements</A> in the queue, i.e. <CODE>Position=1</CODE> and <CODE>Position=2</CODE>, will not move. The relative nature of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1028">priority queue</A> will help you instantly inspect the current <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1029">priority</A> of each <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1030">element</A> in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1031">collection</A>. In earlier versions of SuperMemo, you could observe crowding of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1032">elements</A> at high-priority ranks. For example, you could amass a large number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1033">topics</A> with <CODE><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1034">A-Factor</A>=1.01</CODE> and be practically unable to prioritize within that group. (<CODE><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1035">A-Factor</A>=1.01</CODE> is the lowest possible and would correspond to the highest <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1036">priority</A>). </P>
<P>The fundamental rationale for using a relative <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1037">priority queue</A> is the existence of a form of cognitive bias, which we will call the <I>priority bias</I>. This bias makes us always think that the newly found article is extremely important to read. The new article feels so important, because we underestimate the value of all the previously imported articles. Our memory is unable to produce an effective estimate of the importance of the current mass of remembered knowledge. Even less so is it capable of producing a remotely accurate estimate of the importance of the mass of knowledge stored in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1038">incremental reading</A> process (of which, usually, only a tiny fraction is part of your long-term memories). The net effect is that we always underestimate the volume of what we know, the volume of what we keep in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1039">incremental reading</A>, and the importance distribution of those volumes of knowledge. This psychological mechanism is also the primary force that works against the universal adoption of SuperMemo. Humans are, by biological design, very weak at estimating the size of their knowledge, the cost of learning, and the power of forgetting. As a result, without an intimate knowledge of what SuperMemo is, individuals rarely ever pause to sense the need to use <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="1040">spaced repetition</A>. This underestimation effect is by far more damaging in the case of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_learning" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental learning" data-hasqtip="1041">incremental learning</A>, which is far more complex and has still not been explained in sufficiently simple and catchy terms. </P>
<P>By employing the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1042">priority queue</A>, SuperMemo will help you visualize the <I>priority bias</I> and the process in which large volumes of new material quickly displace the old material from your learning focus. Moreover, SuperMemo highly automates the process in which you can handle material overflow and reconcile high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1043">retention</A> with high volumes of learning. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1044">Incremental reading</A> has always boasted of its capacity to bring the volume of learning to unprecedented levels. With the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1045">priority queue</A>, you can nearly take away the <I>moderation</I> factor and increase the volume of learning even further without undue worry about your hard-earned knowledge. </P>

Can you make it <I>10%</I>? Would you be hurt if it was <I>20%</I>? Would the world collapse if it was <I>66%</I>? With some conscious effort you will realize that you can live without some portions of your knowledge (after all, most people do not use SuperMemo at all and survive ok). Over months of training, you will get better at this. </P>
<P>If you keep peeking at the <A title=Statistics href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Statistics#Protection"><B>Protection</B> statistic</A>, you may also realize that sending <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1067">items</A> beyond your average priority protection will help you clear them from view for a while. This way, if you have created too many <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1068">cloze deletions</A> that crowd your process, you might actually enjoy sending most of them out of the protected zone, and focus on just one or two that capture the essence of knowledge you are trying to learn. </P>
<P>SuperMemo will not help you much in the prioritization work unless you manually play with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1069">intervals</A> (e.g. by saying "<I>this cannot wait 30 days, I must see it in 11</I>"). This tell SuperMemo that the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1070">priority</A> must increase slightly. </P>

<P>In a high-volume <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1071">incremental reading</A> process, you will be served more <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1072">elements</A> in a single day than you could possibly manage to process in a week (or worse). It is therefore vital that you begin your review process from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1073">elements</A> of the highest priority. Low-priority <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1074">elements</A> might linger in the queue for months or years. High-priority <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1075">items</A> should be reviewed at the exact time that SuperMemo finds optimum.

On one hand, due to the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_bias" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority bias" data-hasqtip="1082">priority bias</A>, you will quickly displace older high-quality material with whatever dominates your current interests. That would be a throwback to your pre-SuperMemo times when you kept reading new material, while forgetting your previous investment in learning.

In addition, you might overwhelm your classical SuperMemo repetitions (i.e. question-and-answer review) with the inflow of new articles to read. Again, instead of making sure your previous investment becomes durable, you keep rushing through new material and forgetting the old. </P>

Only a small proportion of time-consuming <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1087">topics</A> is allowed in the learning queue.

<LI>at item failure, you need to rethink the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1155">priority</A>. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1156">Items</A> that fail often are the biggest contributor to slowed progress. Reducing their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1157">priority</A> is one way of remedying this (and possibly helping your memory by inducing the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1158">spacing effect</A> or reducing interference) 
<LI>at article import, high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1159">priority</A> will ensure early reading, however, once you get to reading, you may want to deprioritize and only give high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1160">priority</A> to important <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1161">extracts</A>! You can set the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1162">priority</A> for the entire article and split it all in one go (while reading or by an auto-split). It is however much easier to split the article incrementally as you progress with reading, and only then spread the priorities of all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Child" oldtitle="Glossary:Child" data-hasqtip="1163">children elements</A> with <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Priority">Priority</A>&nbsp;: Spread</B> on the <A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations">browser processing menu</A>. Once you finish reading the article, some of the generated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1164">extracts</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1165">clozes</A> will be given higher <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1166">priority</A> (as per your decision), while most <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1167">elements</A> will get their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1168">priority</A> set automatically on the basis of article's <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1169">priority</A>. This will usually be a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1170">priority</A> that is higher than deserved. Hence <B><A title="Subset operations" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_operations#Priority">Priority</A>&nbsp;: Spread</B> is recommended each time you complete reading an article 
<LI>it makes sense to give new <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1171">clozes</A> a very high <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1172">priority</A> to make sure they are reviewed at least once to "hatch" in your memory. However, once the first repetition ends with success and your future recall at longer <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1173">intervals</A> is a bit more likely, you can provide a more honest <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1174">priority</A>, which is usually lower than when first prioritizing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1175">extracts</A> for the sake of generating <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1176">cloze deletions</A>. If you are still worried about possible forgetting, you can wait with establishing the honest <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1177">priority</A> until the 3rd or 4th review. The longer you wait, the greater the chance you will forget something truly important in the meantime.</LI></UL>
<LI>If you hesitate between a lower <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1178">priority</A> and a higher <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1179">priority</A>, <B>a lower priority is nearly always better!</B> (due to the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_bias" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority bias" data-hasqtip="1180">priority bias</A> that is likely to crowd your learning process) 
<LI>If you skip some of your daily repetition sessions, item protection will drop (as indicated by <B>Priority protection</B> in <B><A title=Analysis href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Analysis">Analysis</A>&nbsp;: Use</B>). If you do not prioritize well, item protection will drop as well. The best way to keep item protection high is to learn regularly, learn a lot, and provide honest priority evaluations 
<LI>Your <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index_in_SuperMemo#measured_forgetting_index">measured forgetting index</A> will increase if you are honest with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1181">priorities</A> in an overloaded <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1182">collection</A>. However, it will more honestly reflect your actual knowledge of the material in the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1183">collection</A>. To see how <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Forgetting_index" oldtitle="Glossary:Forgetting index" data-hasqtip="1184">forgetting index</A> changes with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1185">priority</A>, see <B><A title="Toolkit menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Toolkit_menu">Toolkit</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Toolkit menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Toolkit_menu#Statistics">Statistics</A>&nbsp;: <A title=Analysis href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Analysis">Analysis</A>&nbsp;: <A title=Analysis href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Analysis#Graphs">Graphs</A>&nbsp;: Forgetting index vs. Priority</B> 
<LI>If you manually change the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1186">interval</A>, element <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1187">priorities</A> will change. If you shorten the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1188">interval</A>, the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1189">priority</A> will automatically increase. If you delay the next repetition, the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1190">priority</A> will drop. 
<LI><B>Priority protection</B> can at times drop by a huge margin in a single day. This is not a reason to worry, as long as this does not become a trend. For example, if you discover a set of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1191">clozes</A> whose <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1192">priority</A> is too low, and you increase that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1193">priority</A> in the entire set, all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1194">items</A> that have been <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_element" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding element" data-hasqtip="1195">outstanding</A>, but not at the front of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding queue" data-hasqtip="1196">outstanding queue</A>, will affect the item protection measurement on the next day. This is a one-day phenomenon. However, you will also notice a destructive impact of massive up-prioritizations. It is easy to say "that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Branch" oldtitle="Glossary:Branch" data-hasqtip="1197">branch</A> is very important", and very difficult to undo the damage by indiscriminate change of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1198">priorities</A>. 
<LI>If you are curious which postponed <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1199">item</A> reduced your item protection (<B>Priority protection</B>), choose <B><A title="View menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/View_menu">View</A>&nbsp;: <A title="View menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/View_menu#Recent">Recent</A>&nbsp;: Postponed</B>, choose <B><A title="Browser menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu#Child">Child</A>&nbsp;: Items</B> on the <A title="Browser menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser_menu">browser menu</A>, and sort by <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1200">priority</A> (e.g. by clicking the <B>Prior</B> column heading). The offending <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1201">item</A> should land on top.

<LI>The main difference between lifelong learning and school learning is that schools artificially distort the priority of the learning material. Before an exam, a section of material must receive high priority and high processing, while after the exam, the same material must be realistically re-assessed (which usually means a manifold decrease in priority and heavy dilution of the overload). </LI></UL>

<P>A picture is worth a thousand words. This ageless maxim expresses a well-known fact taken from neuroscience: we have an extremely effective visual memory systems that should be used often to complement the memory systems used for more abstract knowledge that is the chief target of <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A>. Pictures have a great mnemonic power and should be used profusely to illustrate the learning material. SuperMemo implements picture operations that should make your work with pictures easier than ever as long as you master the basic skills of visual learning. </P>
<P><B>Visual learning</B> is an equivalent of <A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A>, but is used to master material represented as pictures. In visual learning, you get a series of pictures as your input, and produce lasting memories of the most important pictures, picture fragments, or annotations associated with pictures. Pictures may be a part of your standard learning process, or be may taken from a specific picture or photo <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1228">collection</A>, e.g. your <A class="external text" href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Why_SuperMemo,_not_Photo_Gallery%3F">family photo album</A>. </P>
<P>The tools and techniques of visual learning can also be used to learn texts that are available only as pictures (e.g. book snapshots, read-only PDF screen prints, paper notes, etc.). A scanner or a digital camera can be used to take pictures of the notes. However, text searches cannot be executed unless high-quality OCR software is used or picture texts are annotated manually. </P>

<P>Incremental video is a technique for learning or watching video recordings with the view to forming lasting memories of the material viewed. Incremental video makes it possible to learn from multiple sources of video without neglecting any one of them. The processing of individual sources proceeds in parallel and time allocations for individual sources depend on student's priorities. Incremental video is to video as <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1369">incremental reading</A> is to learning from electronic texts. In incremental video, it is the user who decides which portions of a video are important to remember. Those portions are part of a standard learning process known from other applications of SuperMemo. Each portion of the video forms a separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1370">topic</A> that is reviewed at increasing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1371">intervals</A>. Despite working with thousands of videos, you do not ever need to feel lost, ever get bored, or ever miss a valuable scene. You can also use SuperMemo as your video or music jukebox. You can work with individual videos for mere seconds. Just as much as is needed to set the new viewing point, determine the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1372">priority</A> and determine the date of the next viewing. This way, you can process dozens of videos daily and work with thousands of videos in parallel. You shall feel overwhelmed with the richness of <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> never again! </P>
<P>On the face of it, incremental video looks like channel-zapping on steroids. However, it is also a powerful learning technique that makes it easy to process thousands of videos in parallel without getting lost. It also makes it easy to learn individual video scenes for long-term <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1373">retention</A>. It can be used to learn sports, master musical instruments, understand biology, or learn fun dialogs in your favorite movies. Individual videos are processed in small portions. Viewing can be resumed at any time at the last viewing position. Best pieces are preserved for repeat viewing. Individual videos are prioritized and served on a daily basis in manageable portions in order of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1374">priority</A>. </P>
<P>Although, incremental video can roughly be implemented with a pair of digital video recorders working in tandem, only SuperMemo provides a bona fide implementation with the whole set of incremental learning tools. SuperMemo makes it possible to learn from standard video files (e.g. MP4). It also makes it easy to learn from <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos.

<P>Incremental video in SuperMemo can use <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos. You can capitalize on the video streaming power of <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> and speed up SuperMemo even though you may suffer video lags on weaker Internet connections. You will also dramatically save on hard disk space. Videos are notorious hogs of space, your <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1375">collections</A> will take a tiny fraction of space needed for video based on local files. <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1376">collection</A> will actually take less space than <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1377">incremental reading</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1378">collections</A> while carrying lots of learning power. If your network is slow or frequently down, you should take comfort in the fact that this situation is likely to change for the better as networks improve worldwide all the time (and this progress is not likely to be slowed soon). Last but not least, SuperMemo will hopefully encourage you to upload your own educational videos to <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> and thus share them with others. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Incremental_video_with_video_files class=mw-headline>Incremental video with video files</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental video in SuperMemo can use video files from your local drive. You do not need to limit your learning to videos available from <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> that can be notoriously volatile (e.g. with accounts closed for copyright violations, embedding blocked by account holders, videos made private, etc.). You are not limited by the need to access the Internet. You can also process private videos. </P>
<P>Using incremental video with local files requires computers with significant processing power. On a strong PC, processing video files is fast and painless. It may be slower on weaker PCs. Your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1379">collections</A> may grow to be terabytes large, which is the main disadvantage of keeping files local. Make sure you have a big dedicated external drive for a backup of your material. The time-scale resolution of local videos is higher than that of <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A>-based videos, which are limited to setting <B>Start</B> and <B>Stop</B> points in increments of 1 second. With local files, you can review fragments that last milliseconds. You can review your best football move at nauseam. Moreover, with local files, you can work when disconnected from the net. </P>
<P>Incremental video can use local files in several video formats (incl. MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, Mpeg, and more). Not all video formats are supported. Before you commit to SuperMemo, give it a try to see if your files can be processed or converted to acceptable format with third party tools. </P>

<P>SuperMemo is a pioneer in implementing versatile incremental video. For those who are familiar with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1380">incremental reading</A> (also pioneered by SuperMemo), incremental video is an analogous technique. Instead of text <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1381">extracts</A>, you generate video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1382">extracts</A>, i.e. portions of a larger video. Video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1383">extracts</A> are viewed repeatedly in increasing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1384">intervals</A> (as it is the case with other pieces of information in SuperMemo). </P>
<P>Individual videos and their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1385">extracts</A> are treated in the same way as all other <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1386">topic elements</A> and enter the learning process according to the rules that are known from <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1387">incremental reading</A>. Currently, only <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Passive_review" oldtitle="Glossary:Passive review" data-hasqtip="1388">passive review</A> of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1389">extracts</A> is supported.

<P>Here are some problems you may encounter when learning with <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A>-based incremental video: </P>
<UL>
<LI><A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos can be removed at any time. They can also have embedding disabled. This is a major problem for the present implementation of YouTube-based incremental video in SuperMemo. There are no API tools that could allow of legal localization of YouTube contents (at the moment of writing). However, the problem mostly affects copyrighted material that shows up on <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> illegally (e.g. movies, music, etc.). Occasionally, video authors themselves remove content. This should never be a problem though if you use your own videos. Hopefully, there will be more and more persistent content uploaded for educational purposes. 
<LI><I>Alt+Left arrow</I> shortcut is used by Internet Explorer to return to the previously visited page. As a result, it also works like an Undo for your <B>Start:Stop</B> setting. To return to the previous page in SuperMemo, use the <B>Back</B> button (<A title="Back enables you to go back to the most recently visited element" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Back.gif"><img alt="Back enables you to go back to the most recently visited element" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/f/f8/Back.gif" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title="Navigation bar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Navigation_bar">navigation bar</A> 
<LI>it may happen that your network is down or the Internet is slow when working with <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> videos. You may therefore prefer to first experiment with a dedicated incremental video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1442">collection</A> to learn how to handle videos and prevent interruptions to learning in cases of network problems. You can always stop working with your incremental video <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1443">collection</A>, return to your regular learning, and resume video learning when the network returns to normal functionality 
<LI>if you would like to use SuperMemo as your <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> jukebox, you should also keep music videos in a single <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1444">collection</A> (or mark them all with a specific keyword for fast <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning">subset learning</A>). You can later hide your jukebox <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1445">collection</A> in the system tray. Your jukebox will play only the selected fragments of individual videos in order of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1446">priority</A> as specified in your <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Sorting_repetitions">sorting criteria</A>. As in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1447">incremental reading</A>, using <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1448">intervals</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1449">priorities</A> is a good remedy against getting bored with a given song or video 
<LI>videos cannot be played in SuperMemo if their embedding is blocked (you will see a message <I>Embedding Disabled By Request</I>). Those videos you can only watch on <A class="external text" href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A>. This means that those videos are pretty useless in your incremental video learning; however, you can still use prioritization and scheduling tools to choose which videos should be played in which sequence and on which day. Note also that many of those videos are uploaded multiple times by various users, and you only need to search for an alternative that can be embedded 
<LI>for technical reasons, some videos (roughly one in a thousand) cannot be watched incrementally (they will ignore <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1450">extracts</A> and always play in their entirety); some can show large rounding errors for extract precision (around 10% of videos can only be watched in large increments). This problem seems to have largely been resolved after 2010. 
<LI>some videos may display loading errors on first entry. Right-click over the video and choose <B>Refresh</B> to reload (or use <I>Alt+Left arrow</I> followed by <I>Alt+Right arrow</I> to revisit the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1451">element</A>).

This problem seems to have largely been resolved with the newer versions of <A class="external text" href="http://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference">YouTube API</A> 
<LI>there are bugs in <A class="external text" href="http://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference">YouTube API</A>, flash player, and Internet Explorer that can interfere with your work. Your <A href="#Your_own_incremental_video_script">script</A> can use <CODE>version=2</CODE> or <CODE>version=3</CODE> of the player. Both have ups and downs. Version 2 tends to hang on very short video pieces that play over and over again (due to a memory leak in Flash software). Version 3 may hang for 10-20 seconds when loading videos preceded with advertising (without actually showing the advertising).</LI></UL>

<P>Videos are handled with the help of <A class="external text" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube Player API</A> in <A title="HTML component" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/HTML_component">HTML components</A> using a small JavaScript program. When you first run SuperMemo, it writes this script into a file stored in the <I>[BIN]</I> subfolder of the folder in which you installed SuperMemo. The name of the file is <I>YouTube.htm</I>. If you know JavaScript, you can substitute your own incremental video script in that file (e.g. to change the layout, size of buttons, or even add new functions for processing videos).

<P>SuperMemo makes it easy to resolve mail overload without neglecting the most important channels of communication. </P>
<P>In addition to prioritizing and managing the communication, SuperMemo helps you: </P>
<OL>
<LI>incorporate e-mail communication into your learning process (e.g. forwarding and discussing important pieces of knowledge) 
<LI>incorporate learning into your e-mail communication (e.g. memorizing important facts related to your mail communication)</LI></OL>
<P>To fully use e-mail functionality in SuperMemo you will need Windows (Live) Mail (or any other e-mail client that support EML) or MS Outlook 2000 or later. At the very minimum, MAPI compatible mail would be needed for sending SuperMemo <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1457">elements</A> or objects via mail. </P>
<P>Here are the most important ways you can use SuperMemo in mail processing, and use e-mail in communicating your SuperMemo work: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Prioritizing mail</B>: To make sure you always begin with the most important pieces, you should use the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1458">priority queue</A> to prioritize mail. Possibly, you will not manage to answer all mail, however, you will always do your best in processing top-priority messages. 
<LI><B>Using incremental learning tools to process mail</B>: <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1459">Incremental reading</A> is a powerful tool that helps you prioritize, schedule, and process mail. As a result, you may decide that instead of using your mail software, it is more convenient and rational to use SuperMemo to read and respond to your e-mail. Users of Windows (Live) Mail or MS Outlook can now import all their mail to SuperMemo with a keystroke. If you receive more mail than you are able to effectively process, you can use overload tools. You will immediately process only the most important pieces and proceed with others according to their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1460">priority</A> in proportion of available time. As in the learning process, rescheduling and sorting happens in the background, so that you never lose sleep over delaying a reply or being slow with processing excess mail. You can respond to longer pieces incrementally. 
<LI><B>Sending learning data to others</B>: If you encounter valuable information in incremental learning (or when processing mail), you can send it to your colleagues, friends, partners or family with a single click for inspiration or further discussion. For example, while reading an article about decoding human genome, you might find out that <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter">Craig Venter of Celera</A> comes from a Mormon family and that his father was eventually excommunicated. You can send such a note (or the whole article) from SuperMemo to your Mormon friend with a click of a button. 
<LI><B>Using mail material in incremental learning</B>: You may also incorporate snippets of mail in your learning process. You can treat most valuable pieces of e-mail as articles to read. If you receive highly inspirational messages, you may want to introduce it into incremental learning and memorize its portions to ensure long-term benefit. In other words, your mail may not only prompt action, but may also be used in learning to keep your memory up-to-date with things you care about. This way you can also learn from materials sent from others, esp. if those materials come in small portions extracted from an incremental learning process conducted by other people. You can also comment or respond to individual portions of the processed mail. You can do it while reading or when new ideas come to your mind upon review. You can use this process for the purpose of creativity (e.g. reviewing an inspiring idea or information in different contexts) or for the purpose of recall (e.g. trying to remember the university major of your cousin).</LI></OL>

<H3><SPAN id=Advantages class=mw-headline>Advantages</SPAN></H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>recall of important facts</B>: if you learn new things from e-mail sent by others, you can easily introduce the most valuable pieces into the learning process (via standard <B>Extract</B> or <I>Alt+X</I>). Those pieces will be reviewed as other pieces of knowledge in SuperMemo. If you decide to respond to a given inspirational fragment, the sender address will automatically be used when you click the <B>E-mail</B> button (<A title="SuperMemo: Send a copy of the element (or its part) in an e-mail message" class=image href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Send_e-mail.png"><img alt="SuperMemo: Send a copy of the element (or its part) in an e-mail message" src="https://help.supermemo.org/images/e/e9/Send_e-mail.png" width=16 height=16 decoding="async"></A>) on the <A title="Navigation bar" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Navigation_bar">navigation bar</A>. Incremental processing will help you remember names, contexts, events, and facts far better than when using other methods. You will not experience mental chaos caused by an overcrowded Inbox 
<LI><B>prioritization</B>: if you get more e-mail material than you are able to process, you can use incremental learning tools for prioritizing mail and its fragments. One of the greatest strengths of incremental learning is its unique system for efficiently determining the priority of the reading material with the help of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority_queue" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority queue" data-hasqtip="1470">priority queue</A>. Remember to politely inform everyone about your e-mail processing system. Otherwise you may easily be accused of acting as an <I>e-mail black hole</I> 
<LI><B>handling overflow</B>: you can use <B><A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">Postpone</A></B> and other rescheduling tools to resolve the excessive inflow of information without damage to your selected priority criteria. If you work in a team, it is a great idea to delegate some of your work; however, not all work can be delegated. Additionally, if you delegate, you do not learn from e-mail that you delegate. To answer the latter problem, you can choose a solution in the middle: delegate e-mail jobs and process inflowing pieces with the tools of incremental learning</LI></OL>
<H3><SPAN id=Disadvantages_2 class=mw-headline>Disadvantages</SPAN></H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>splintering e-mail</B>: some people dislike <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=splinter">splintered</A> responses. They prefer to have their e-mail analyzed as a whole and responded to as a whole (preferably within an hour&nbsp;:). As an act of kindness, try to remember people's preferences and do not use incremental e-mail processing (too much) on those who do not like it 
<LI><B>incremental approach is not transitive</B>: incremental e-mail processing shows the greatest power for longer pieces of mail, article forwards, etc. For very short e-mail messages, incremental e-mail processing delivers less value per unit time. Because incremental mail processing leads to short communication bursts, it undermines its own power when used at both ends of the communication channel. However, even if you communicate in short sentences (i.e. without SuperMemo), keep the record of mail in your <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1471">collection</A> for <A title="Subset review" class=mw-redirect href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_review#Search_and_review">Search and review</A></LI></OL>

<LI>(optionally) once you run out of time, process some mail without responding to re-prioritize and reschedule the most important pieces manually (rather than leaving them to automatic rescheduling)</LI></OL>
<P>Naturally, as with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1478">incremental reading</A>, the time you choose to progress through individual stages is important for efficiency. <B>Processing stage</B> should fall into time slots with best alertness and mental performance. <B>Review stage</B> can be done at other times, incl. while multi-tasking. This approach eliminates the instant nature of mail, but makes the entire process more reasonable, esp. if volumes are far beyond manageable. Although many pieces of mail will get substantially delayed (or perhaps even neglected), top-priority mail will be processed in the first order, and damage done by urgency will be less. The above strategy may introduce an inevitable delay of up to 4 days in replying (Day #1 arrival, #2 review, #3 prioritizing, #4 processing); however, in <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1479">incremental reading</A>, it is always the priority and quality that should come first ahead of speed and urgency.

Use <I>Ctrl+Shift+R</I> on first reading to determine when you want to reply to an e-mail 
<LI>SuperMemo picks the earliest <I>[mailto:</I> tag from your e-mail text as the default response addressee. If you would like to send pieces of an article to a selected person, put this tag with the address anywhere in the text. For example: <I>[mailto:johndoe@hotmail.com]</I> (note the square brackets around the tag and the missing space between <I>mailto:</I> and the address). You can specify multiple recipients by separating their names with a semicolon. For example: <I>[mailto:miko;alex]</I> where <I>miko</I> and <I>alex</I> must be defined in your mail program's address book (e.g. Windows Live Mail address book). Adding the <I>[mailto:</I> tag is useful when you want to ask many questions or forward many pieces of a single mail to a single person whose address is complex and is not defined in your address book 
<LI>Optionally, add a degree of randomization in your <A title="Priority queue" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Sorting_repetitions">Sorting criteria</A> to prevent "tunnel vision" in processing. For example, we all suffer from a <I>recency bias</I> where recently arrived mail is ranked higher in priority than mail that arrived earlier.

<P>Both processes are based on <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1506">incremental reading</A>. By analogy to <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1507">incremental reading</A>, this process is called <I>incremental writing</I>. </P>
<P>The technique of incremental writing was used to compile some of the materials at <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com">super-memory.com</A>. Most notably, <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm">Good sleep, good learning, good life (2012)</A>, and the present <A class="mw-selflink selflink">Incremental learning (2013)</A> article. </P>
<P>The main difference between traditional writing and incremental writing is that the writer is free to re-organize the material and review it with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1508">incremental reading</A> tools. </P>
<P>The main difference between <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1509">incremental reading</A> and incremental writing is that the "big picture" of the article is built primarily within the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1510">collection</A>, and to a lesser extent in the writer's mind. This is suitable for large fact-packed material that is difficult to organize sequentially. In addition, one's own writing may be the source of most input, as opposed to external electronic sources. Incremental writing is also suitable in a compilation of a large body of prior writing, esp. of materials that are repetitive, fact-rich, and often loosely connected. Incremental writing is less useful for texts with a linear line of thought. </P>
<P>Incremental article writing is an open-ended process that can be interrupted at any stage for the article to be exported to as a single document for text-flow rewrites. </P>
<P>Articles written using incremental writing may be particularly suitable for <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1511">incremental reading</A>.

They may be bloated and repetitive, however, with <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1514">incremental reading</A>, they can be prioritized in a rational way.

<P>When the fun of writing is gone, the writer's block can ensue. SuperMemo makes writing fun as compared to traditional methods (e.g. writing in a word processor). If you are in no mood to write about one topic today, you might be more inclined to try something else. If you are in no mood for writing anything, tackle some minor clean up jobs. Very often, once you start writing, you get sucked into the effort and the mood returns. A piece of information can trigger new ideas. If it happens in your writing slot, you can instantly write down new ideas. You can write them rough and short. But you need to write them instantly. If you keep waiting, the memory of the inspiration whittles down to just the need to write about a subject! This is how forgetting affects your own ideas! Strike the iron while it's hot. Process inspiration incrementally, and pick the pieces that raise most enthusiasm at any given moment. Those pieces will generate most new creative value. </P>

Incremental writing should primarily be considered by authors who are already masters of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1551">incremental reading</A>. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Incremental_brainstorming class=mw-headline>Incremental brainstorming</SPAN></H2>
<P>If you combine incremental learning with <A href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</A> and plain old brainstorming, you will arrive at <I>incremental brainstorming</I>. The brainstorming part may be executed face-to-face or over e-mail. </P>
<P>Incremental brainstorming sounds like an oxymoron. Incremental brainstorming has very little to do with "storming", but it makes a very good use of the brain's capacity to build creative associations in fertile knowledge-rich conditions. Incremental brainstorming might be slow, but it can deliver more than plain face-to-face brainstorming. At worst, the outcome will be different, and in creative work, this is always a desirable complementary effect. </P>
<P>In face-to-face brainstorming, two or more brains, preferably with different strengths, specializations, and biases, engage into a fast exchange of ideas, where Idea X from Brain A might generate ideas Y and Z from Brain B, which in turn may cause a chain reaction of creative inspiration in other participating brains. Moreover, brainstorming requires a degree of mental discipline that may be missing in brainstorming with oneself (in one's mind, i.e. without incremental learning). Converting thoughts to speech slows down the thinking, but increases the discipline and may dramatically enhance creative outcomes. </P>
<P>In incremental brainstorming, this process is taken a few steps further. Incremental learning is a form of brainstorming with oneself, as mentioned in the <B><A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Creativity_boost">Creativity</A></B> section, however, it can also be used in remote brainstorming via e-mail.

<LI>e-mail communication (which may be supplemented by live video).</LI></OL>
<P>Incremental brainstorming may be slow, and yet it adds an additional degree of discipline with an archive of written communications. Most of all, it adds more sources of inspiration to the mix. In addition to the participating brains, incremental brainstorming adds inspiration from external sources of knowledge (with non-participating authors providing further inspiration). It also adds from the history of the communication. Due to forgetting, incremental brainstorming makes it possible to brainstorm with one's past self. In other words, the participants of incremental brainstorming include: </P>

<LI><B>wider knowledge</B>: involvement of incremental learning in expanding upon the discussed ideas substantially extends the knowledge used in the creative process. This is a way of adding non-participating brains to the mix 
<LI><B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1552">spacing effect</A></B>: when brainstorming is slowed down, fading memory traces evoke the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1553">spacing effect</A> that may:

<LI>evoke new creative reasoning pathways in cases where the fading signal needs to be rebuilt via new pathway searches. </LI></OL>This is particularly valuable for hard-to-solve problems that may require the involvement of long-term memory and all its advantages (incl. problem modelling) 
<LI><B>circadian synchronization</B>: participating brains do not need to synchronize their peek performance hours (e.g. when working over different times zones) 
<LI><B>sleep</B>: few people realize the monumental role of sleep in creativity. <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep">Neural optimization of memories in sleep</A> works like an automatic creative thinker that is autonomous from the conscious brain even though it feeds on creative processes that occur in waking. <B>Sleep is an organizer of memories and can convert results of brainstorming into new quality</B>. Incremental brainstorming is slower, it may span weeks or months. As such, it employs sleep mechanisms as new autonomous brains in the creative process. Sleep converts the chaos of data into abstract models that yield higher quality reasoning 
<LI><B>balancing attention and creativity</B>: in all creative pursuits, striking the ideal balance between creativity and attention is vital for the ultimate success. Our multitasking society is pretty good at stimulating creativity, however, the same factors that boost creativity have a destructive impact on attention. Incremental brainstorming helps you strike a balance between focused individual work and pulling the team brains together. You can brainstorm without ever interrupting each other 
<LI><B>free from reliance on the coincidence of interests</B>: face-to-face brainstorming often fails due to differing levels of interests or motivations in the participating parties. Moderating face-to-face and adding a bigger dose of incremental brainstorming may be an easy solution. In those cases, most of the workload may shift to a single brain, while still capitalizing on the contribution of the less involved brains </LI></UL>
<H3><SPAN id=Disadvantages_of_incremental_brainstorming class=mw-headline>Disadvantages of incremental brainstorming</SPAN></H3>
<P>The main disadvantage of incremental brainstorming is its snail's speed. Naturally, it won't be of much value right before a project's deadline. However, despite the hype speed receives in the media in reference to technological progress, the hardest problems are always solved by collective efforts of multiple brains working over generations. Incremental brainstorming might be less useful in hurrying a new iPad model, but it would be handy in slowly developing or slowly adopting theories like those of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Mendel</A>, <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener">Wegener</A>, and the like. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Future_of_brainstorming class=mw-headline>Future of brainstorming</SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental brainstorming is not intended to replace face-to-face interactive collaboration. However, it should serve as its rich supplement. It carries all the advantages of incremental learning: creativity, attention, prioritization, meticulousness, consolidation, long-term sustainability based on long-term memories, and more. It requires a lot of training before it brings fruits. Therefore, if problem solving or creative work are vital for your progress, you might consider mastering the following progression of skills: classical SuperMemo (for better memory), incremental reading (for processing text), incremental learning (for overall learning), incremental problem solving (for employing knowledge in solving problems), to finally arrive at incremental brainstorming, i.e. combining incremental learning with classical brainstorming. </P>

<LI>I type up the main points of my intended article as a topic in SuperMemo, and then extract them.

<LI>As my knowledge grows, so does my article, and some of the original extracts can undergo further extracting, in order to elaborate on individual points. 
<LI>When I am satisfied, I can collect all the elaborated extracts (located in the children) and bring it back to the parent article, resulting in a well-developed article. 
<LI>The problem is that I don't want individual fragments to increase their intervals to 200 or 300 days or more because then I may never finish writing the article. So I have to adjust the intervals manually.</LI></UL>
<P>The advantages of a slow and incremental approach to writing articles (and possibly in any other type of creative endevour) are similar to regular SMIR.

<DD>Yours is a very healthy and creative way of using <A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A>. This is not exactly "opposite to learning with IR". This is more like a creative way to enhance your recall and understanding. Few things contribute as much to your learning as formulating other people's ideas in your own way. Long and complex articles can often be effectively summarized in 2-3 short sentences and thus contribute far more to your comprehension and long-term recall of the essential knowledge. One thing remains unclear, why should this function be separated from SuperMemo, and what tools are missing from <A title="Incremental reading" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> toolkit to enhance this process. -- SuperMemo Support</DD></DL>

<DD>When writing an article in this style the outcome that I have reached time and time again is a large tree structure (in the Contents window) with the most important information at the leaves (something like the outcome of incremental reading). To turn this information into an "article", one has to go to each leave individually and copy the text, then return to the original parent and paste it in order. Hence, I see the need for a "recomposition" tool that can take all information in the leaves and paste it into a single element using the order specified by the tree structure. -- Georgios Zonnios</DD></DL></DD></DL>

<P>SuperMemo 18 features an innovative form of <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A>, which we will call <B>neural learning</B>. In neural learning, SuperMemo serves the student with knowledge associated with a selected subject, article, picture, etc. Knowledge is served in a neural way, i.e. by sequentially exploring semantic connections in a networks of information build automatically or manually in SuperMemo. SuperMemo takes inspiration from how the brain works. Creativity enhanced with SuperMemo is very slow, but it is targeted and methodical. <B>Neural creativity works like a slow brain extended by memories stored in SuperMemo.</B> Neural learning is particularly useful in research, problem solving, creative writing, explorative learning, etc. In other words, you may not find neural learning particularly useful in mastering a course of physics, however, if you are a physicist working on a complex problem that requires associating knowledge from different fields of physics and beyond, you will notice that this form of learning has a fantastic impact on your creative productivity. </P>

A concept in SuperMemo is an equivalent of an important idea, which can be connected with other elements (incl. other concepts).

Elements connected via concepts form <B>concept maps</B>, which, in addition to the knowledge tree, form the primary skeleton for explorations in neural learning. </P>

<P>Neural review is a <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning">subset review</A> that follows meaningful connections between pieces of knowledge. It takes inspiration from how the brain follows associated ideas. Neural review automates the review of knowledge associated with selected concepts or ideas, e.g. in problem solving, creative writing, etc. </P>
<P>For example, in a neural review of <I>dogs</I>, there is a good chance of learning about <I>puppies</I> or <I>pooddles</I>, but there is also a chance of learning about <I>cats</I> and somewhat lesser chance of learning about <I>cars</I>. Similarly, if you see a picture of a banana plant, going neural on that picture will help you review associated elements (e.g. other pictures of plants, or articles about bananas, or <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1654">elements</A> associated with the same <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept" oldtitle="Glossary:Concept" data-hasqtip="1655">concept</A> such as <I>gardening</I>). </P>
<P>A <B>concept</B> in SuperMemo is an important idea or subject. Concepts are a new type of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1656">element</A> that can be linked with other elements. The network of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link" oldtitle="Glossary:Link" data-hasqtip="1657">links</A> based on concepts will be called a <B>concept map</B>. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1658">Elements</A> can also form <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link" oldtitle="Glossary:Link" data-hasqtip="1659">links</A> between each other. In SuperMemo, knowledge is also connected by inheritance, and the structure of the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Knowledge_tree" oldtitle="Glossary:Knowledge tree" data-hasqtip="1660">knowledge tree</A>. </P>
<P><A href="#Spreading_activation">Spreading activation</A> in neural networks is a method of searching the network with the use of network connections and weights. </P>
<P>Neural review follows the <I>spread of neural activation</I> in a network of inter-element connections. All the links and connections in SuperMemo can be used to simulate a spread of activation in the network of knowledge where individual <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1661">elements</A> play a role of neurons. </P>
<P>All <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link" oldtitle="Glossary:Link" data-hasqtip="1662">links</A> used in spreading activation receive weights based on their importance. In SuperMemo, weights are determined by <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1663">element priority</A> and the priorities of individual knowledge associations (e.g. concept connections are of higher priority than the sibling relationship in the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Knowledge_tree" oldtitle="Glossary:Knowledge tree" data-hasqtip="1664">knowledge tree</A>). </P>
<P>In spreading activation, we can sequence the propagation wave by the time of activation of individual nodes, which are formed by SuperMemo <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Element" oldtitle="Glossary:Element" data-hasqtip="1665">elements</A>. Such a sequence can then be used as the basis of a semantic review in the incremental learning process. </P>
<P>Neural review can be initiated by executing <B><A title="Learn menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn_menu">Learn</A>&nbsp;: <A title="Learn menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn_menu#Go_neural">Go neural</A></B> (<I>Ctrl+F2</I>) from the <A title="Main menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Main_menu">main menu</A>. </P>
<P>Neural review carries a degree of randomness. As such it can be very helpful in associating ideas in neural creativity. Connectivity and randomness underlie the main rationale behind neural review: <B>neural creativity</B> and <B>neural problem solving</B>. In those approaches, we combine a creative process or a problem solving process with an exploration of new subjects, while executing <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A> in the background. In other words, neural review serves learning that is to instantly bring benefits in the shape of new ideas and new problems solved in conditions of incomplete human knowledge and in combination with abundant and possibly contradictory computer-stored knowledge. A typical use of neural creativity would be to diagnose a rare disease on the basis of its symptoms (see <A href="#Examples_of_neural_creativity">examples</A>). </P>

<H2><SPAN id=Neural_creativity_2 class=mw-headline>Neural creativity</SPAN></H2>
<P><B>Neural creativity</B> is creativity induced with the help of neural review. In neural review, SuperMemo successively feeds the user with knowledge associated with a selected topic or a chosen subset of topics. When a network of conceptual <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link" oldtitle="Glossary:Link" data-hasqtip="1730">links</A> connects areas of knowledge, they form semantic space that can be explored in a neural manner that helps forming new associations, and generate ideas. This process is conducive to research, invention, problem solving, etc. Metaphorically speaking, neural creativity helps emulate a thinking process in a human brain extended by knowledge stored in SuperMemo. </P>
<P>Neural creativity employs the incremental learning process to produce new ideas in a neural fashion. In neural creativity, closely related <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept" oldtitle="Glossary:Concept" data-hasqtip="1731">concepts</A> are more likely to show up when executing a neural review of a studied subject. If you are fluent in <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A>, you may wonder how a neural review differs from a <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Semantic_review">semantic review</A>. The main difference is that in semantic review the whole burden of juggling the semantics is in your hands. You need to know the tools of <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A> to execute a <A title="Subset learning" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning#Semantic_review">semantic review</A> well. In neural review, the whole process will be reduced to pressing a single button in SuperMemo. </P>
<P>Unlike it is the case with semantic review in SuperMemo, or simply googling for knowledge, the whole process of associating pieces of knowledge is automated. To give it a try, pick a subject and <B>Go neural</B> (<I>Ctrl+F2</I>). </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Incremental_approach class=mw-headline>Incremental approach</SPAN></H2>
<P><A class="mw-selflink selflink">Incremental learning</A> can be used to creatively come up with new ideas. This raises some skepticism. Here is an exemplary skeptical voice: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>"How can interruption be good for creativity or problem solving? Isn't it that all great discoveries come from continual, persistent and focused effort? It is those who can dedicate themselves to a cause that achieve best results. Most people fail because they major in minor things. They do many things superficially. They are jacks of all trade and masters of none. Incremental learning seems like an effort to major in everything. Putting too much on one's own plate".</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This question keeps popping back in various contexts. Here is an illustrative answer based on the fact that creativity and problem solving are based on forming new connections in your brain. </P>
<P><B>Incremental recall: bringing back things to memory, piece by piece</B> </P>
<P>Imagine you had a very eventful day. For example, a visit to an exotic city, meeting an old good friend, or attending a breakthrough conference. Imagine that your inspiration is so rich that you want to write a detailed report of the day (assuming you did not capture it all with <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass">Google Glass</A>). The first thing to do is to sit down to writing a report and list all essential keywords for rebuilding the memory of the day. Once you write the outline, you can quickly notice that it does not take long before you come up blank for new memories. You cannot recall any more details. This is normal. Sitting down over a blank piece of paper for an hour may not be the best use of your time. It may be pretty unproductive. However, if you keep your piece of paper handy, you may notice that it keeps filling up with new memories as they keep popping up in your head in different contexts. An image, a smell, or an article in press may all contribute to unexpected recall. If you happen to execute <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A> in the meantime, you will notice that the process of recall is intensified. If your learning materials are rich, you are likely to read about dozens of unrelated subjects in a single day. All those subjects produce new associations. Your blank piece of paper will fill up much faster than it is the case in the course of ordinary life or if your learning was less varied. What you witness here is incremental recall. </P>
<P>There is a short step from incremental recall to incremental creativity. Both are based on incrementally building a mental structure in your mind. In case of recall, you will recover past memories. In case of creativity, you will additionally add </P>
<OL>
<LI>new pieces of knowledge acquired via <A class="mw-selflink selflink">incremental learning</A> (e.g. neural review), and 
<LI>new memories and/or ideas you have not experienced or thought of before.</LI></OL>
<P>Finally, in problem solving, you will direct this creative process towards accomplishing a specific task: solving a problem, answering a question, etc. </P>
<H2><SPAN id=Examples_of_neural_creativity class=mw-headline>Examples of neural creativity</SPAN></H2>
<P>Neural tools in SuperMemo equip the user with a sort of Einstein's brain in slow motion. You can build a brain of knowledge as big as you wish. You can make your networks of ideas as complex as you wish. And then you can just press one button to start a train of thought at your own pace while watching all new ideas form in front of your eyes. Here are some examples of the neural approach in SuperMemo: </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Medical_diagnosis class=mw-headline>Medical diagnosis</SPAN></H3>
<P>Physicians and medical students always have a mountain of new health-related knowledge to process. This is also true of all individuals who care about health. A specific problem to solve, e.g. a medical diagnosis, may also be a good excuse for acquiring new knowledge neural style. For example, if a patient presents with a skin condition, a dedicated <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept" oldtitle="Glossary:Concept" data-hasqtip="1732">concept</A> might be created (e.g. <I>Patient John Doe condition</I>). <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Link" oldtitle="Glossary:Link" data-hasqtip="1733">Conceptual links</A> can then be made to relevant fields of knowledge, e.g. skin conditions, allergies, bacterial skin infections, mycoses, etc. Neural review will provide new inspiration for new areas to explore. Two birds can be killed with one stone: </P>

<LI>new knowledge acquired for future use, and

<H3><SPAN id=Solving_a_software_problem class=mw-headline>Solving a software problem</SPAN></H3>
<P>Neural review has already been helpful in solving problems that pester users of SuperMemo (e.g. <A class="external text" href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Cloze_deletions_get_shifted_by_one_character">misaligned cloze deletion</A>, due to bugs in Internet Explorer). When a pesky problem shows up, all related knowledge can be associated with a <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Concept" oldtitle="Glossary:Concept" data-hasqtip="1734">concept</A> that defines the problem (e.g. <I>cloze bug</I>). </P>
<P>In the case of the "cloze bug", several users sent their ideas on how to possibly solve the problem. None of these worked. In the end, all <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</A>-related ideas turned out to be a blind path. However, initiating neural review provided an ultimate incentive with a hope for a light in the tunnel. Could the problem be solved without neural review? Yes. Perhaps, neural review helped step out of the box in looking for solutions? If not, it might at least have had a psychological effect: <I>"if nothing works, perhaps neural review will?"</I>. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Creative_writing class=mw-headline>Creative writing</SPAN></H3>
<P><A title="Creativity and problem solving in SuperMemo" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo#Incremental_writing">Incremental writing</A> is useful if you want to compile a number of texts into a larger body. Neural approach may be useful if you want to combine that procedure with a degree of research. You may either want to research a topic (e.g. when looking for facts or literature related to your thesis), or research your own texts if they are too voluminous and highly repetitive (e.g. to look for simpler phrasing, more logical sequencing, clearer line of thought, etc.). </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Forensic_science class=mw-headline>Forensic science</SPAN></H3>
<P>Forensics is an excellent example of where neural approach may appear useful. A complex case may involve a great deal of case-specific knowledge that needs to be combined with scientific and general knowledge. Wherever the size of knowledge goes well beyond the capacity of human memory, and where the solution may require thinking "out of the box", neural approach may act as an extension to the human mind. Once a case is solved, case-independent knowledge may be integrated with the main learning <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Collection" oldtitle="Glossary:Collection" data-hasqtip="1735">collection</A> to secure the long-term investment in knowledge. </P>

<P>SuperMemo always had to struggle with myths slowing down its popularization. Preventing the reappearance of myths appears to be a never-ending battle. The knowledge about SuperMemo has grown to a substantial volume. Not all users can afford reading dozens of articles. Many users are bound to arrive to the same wrong conclusions independently of others. Some of these myths are rooted in general myths of memory. Others seem to spring from the common sense thinking about learning. Here are some most damaging myths related to spaced repetition, SuperMemo, and incremental learning. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_Many_people_are_successful_without_using_SuperMemo.2C_hence_its_importance_is_secondary></SPAN><SPAN id=Myth:_Many_people_are_successful_without_using_SuperMemo,_hence_its_importance_is_secondary class=mw-headline>Myth: Many people are successful without using SuperMemo, hence its importance is secondary</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: Many people are successful without using SuperMemo, hence its importance is secondary</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Neither <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</A> nor <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issac_Newton">Newton</A> had access to computers, yet computer illiteracy may make today's scientist entirely impotent. Similarly, with a growing importance of knowledge, neglecting the competitive advantage of a wider and stable knowledge will increasingly limit your chances of successful career in science, engineering, medicine, politics, etc. You can live without SuperMemo, but it can definitely raise your learning to a new level. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_Natural_mechanisms_for_selecting_important_memories_are_good_enough._We_do_not_need_a_crutch class=mw-headline>Myth: Natural mechanisms for selecting important memories are good enough. We do not need a crutch</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: Natural mechanisms for selecting important memories are good enough. We do not need a crutch</B>. The evolution produced an effective forgetting mechanism that frees our memory from space-consuming and perhaps irrelevant garbage. This mechanism proved efficient enough to build the amazing human civilization. Consequently, many believe that there cannot be much room for improvement.<BR><B>Fact</B>: The forgetting mechanism was built in abstraction from our wishes and decisions. It only spares memories that are used frequently enough. Nowadays, we are smart enough to decide on our own which knowledge is vital and which is not. A single peek into a dictionary may often take more time than the lifetime time cost of refreshing the same word in SuperMemo. This is just the least spectacular example. Human history is rich in monumental errors coming from ignorance. NASA's confusion of imperial and metric units cost a lost Mars probe. Confusion of comma with a dot in Fortran, cost a Venus probe. Errors in English communication caused many aerial and maritime catastrophes. A piece of knowledge in surgeon's mind may be worth the life of his patient. Forgetting is too precarious to leave mission-critical knowledge to your brain's own devices. SuperMemo puts you in the driver's seat. You can decide what your remember and what you forget.

<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_We_cannot_improve_memory_by_training class=mw-headline>Myth: We cannot improve memory by training</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: We cannot improve memory by training</B>. Infinite memory is a popular optimist's myth. A pessimist's myth is that we cannot improve our memory via training. Even <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James</A> in his genius book <I><A class="external text" href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/">The Principles of Psychology (1890)</A></I> wrote with certainty that memory does not change unless for the worse (e.g. as a result of aging or disease).<BR><B>Fact</B>: If considered at a very low synaptic level, memory is indeed quite resistant to improvement. Not only does it seem to change little in the course of healthy life. It is also very similar in its properties across the human population. At the very basic level, synapses of a low-IQ individual are as trainable as that of a genius. They are also not much different from those of a mollusk <I>Aplysia</I> or a fly <I>Drosophila</I>. However, there is more to memory and learning than just a single synapse. The main difference between poor students and geniuses is in their skill to represent information for learning. A genius quickly dismembers information and forms simple models that make thinking easy. Simple models of reality help understand it, process it, and remember it. What <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James</A> failed to mention is that a week-long course in <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_techniques">mnemonic techniques</A> dramatically increases learning skills for many people. Their molecular or synaptic memory may not improve. What improves is their skill to handle knowledge. Consequently, they can remember more and for longer. Learning is a self-accelerating and self-amplifying process. As such it often leads to miraculous results. </P>

No <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1739">item</A> added to SuperMemo is considered "memorized for good". For that reasons, all <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1740">items</A> are subject to review sooner or later. There must therefore be an inevitable increase in the cost of repetitions.<BR><B>Fact</B>: It is true that a large number of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Outstanding_element" oldtitle="Glossary:Outstanding element" data-hasqtip="1741">outstanding repetitions</A> is the primary excuse for SuperMemo drop-outs. However, computer simulations as well as real-life measurements show that, with the constant daily learning time, the acquisition of new knowledge does not visibly slow down in time except for the very first couple of months. In other words, from a long-term perspective, the acquisition of new knowledge is <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm#Figure+1">nearly linear</A>. Older <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1742">items</A> are repeated less and less frequently leaving room for new material. The exponential nature of this "fading" explains why we can continue with a heavy inflow of new material for decades. </P>

<P><B>Myth: People differ in the speed of learning, but they all forget at the same speed</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Although there are mutations that might affect the forgetting rate, at the synaptic level, the rate of forgetting is indeed basically the same (independent of how smart you are). However, the same thing that makes people learn faster, helps them forget slower. The key to learning and slow forgetting is representation (i.e. the way knowledge is formulated). If you learn with <A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</A>, you will know that <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1743">items</A> can be very difficult or very easy. The difficult ones are forgotten much faster and require shorter <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1744">intervals</A> between repetitions. The key to making <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1745">items</A> easy is to <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">formulate them well</A>. Moreover, good students will show better performance on the exactly same material. This is because the ultimate test on the formulation of knowledge is not in how it is structured in your learning material, but in the way it is stored in your mind. With massive learning effort, you will gradually improve the way you absorb and represent knowledge in your mind. The fastest student is the one who can instinctively visualize and store knowledge in his mind using imagery that provide minimum-information and maximum-connectivity. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_Hypertext_can_substitute_for_memory class=mw-headline>Myth: Hypertext can substitute for memory</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: Hypertext can substitute for memory</B>. An amazingly large proportion of the population holds memorization in contempt. Terms "<I>rote memorization</I>", "<I>recitatory rehearsal</I>", "<I>mindless repetition</I>" are used to label any form of memorization or repetition as unintelligent. Seeing the "<I>big picture</I>", "<I>reasoning</I>" and leaving the job of remembering to external hypertext sources are supposed to be viable substitutes.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Knowledge stored in human memory is associative in nature. In other words, we are able to suddenly combine two known ideas to produce a new quality: an invention. Hypertext references are a poor substitute for associative memory. Two facts stored in human memory can instantly be put together and bring a new idea to life. The same facts stored on the Internet will remain useless until they are pieced together inside a creative mind. A mind rich in knowledge, can produce rich associations upon encountering new information. An empty mind is as useful as a toddler given the power of the Internet in search of a solution. Biological neural networks work in such a way that knowledge is retained in memory only if it is refreshed/reviewed. Learning and repetition are therefore still vital for the progress of mankind. This humorous text explains the importance of memory: <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/users/memorizing.htm">It is not just memorizing</A> </P>

<P><B>Myth: We do not need SuperMemo, all we need is to build an index to knowledge sources</B>. With multiple on-line sources of knowledge, some people are tempted to believe that all we are supposed to learn is a sort of index to these external sources of knowledge.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Even "index to knowledge" is subject to forgetting and needs to be maintained via repetition or review. All creative geniuses need knowledge to form new concepts. The extent of this knowledge will vary, but the creative output does depend on the volume of knowledge, its associative nature, and its abstractness (i.e. its relevance in building models). </P>
<H4><SPAN id=Index_to_knowledge class=mw-headline>Index to knowledge</SPAN></H4>
<P>A less extreme version of "<A href="#Myth:_Memorization_is_not_needed">memorization is not needed</A>" myth, is that "we only need to remember an index to knowledge". It is true that abstract knowledge and general concepts are most useful. However, this type of knowledge is also subject to forgetting. Moreover, not all knowledge is inferential. To reason about <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</A>, we often need to know that it is cold. We might derive the temperature conclusion from the position of <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</A> on the map, but we need the knowledge of the map, the knowledge of the climate, and the knowledge of the earth's position in reference to the sun. Any kid will admit that it is simpler to just remember that <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</A> is white and cold. In this case, rules are more useful, but facts are easier to remember. </P>
<P>A <I>mere mortal</I> will usually be aware that doughnuts are foods that should better be avoided by people who fear a heart disease. The fact "<I>Doughnuts ain't good for heart</I>" contributes to an average man's knowledge about health. This fact probably does not need SuperMemo. After all, most of us will refresh the knowledge about doughnuts and the heart each time we see a tasty doughnut. The <I>Doughnut Fact</I> contributes also to our <I>index to knowledge</I>. It is enough to jump to Google and type <I>+doughnut +heart</I> to make a good use of this particular entry in our index. The search will help us recover more knowledge about the <I>relationship</I> between doughnuts and the heart. </P>
<P>If we want to enhance our ability to think and conclude about doughnuts and the heart, we might try to remember the following: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Fact 1</B>: <I>Doughnuts are high in trans fatty acids</I> 
<LI><B>Rule 1</B>: <I>Trans fatty acids in foods tend to lower <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein">HDLs</A> (high-density lipoproteins)</I> 
<LI><B>Rule 2</B>: <I>Lower blood <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein">HDLs</A> are a major risk factor in cardiovascular disorders (e.g. arteriosclerosis)</I></LI></OL>
<P>There is an advantage to knowing the above facts and rules: upon finding out that <I>French fries are high in trans fatty acids</I>, we will be able to use <B>Rule 1</B> and <B>Rule 2</B> to derive a new fact: <I>French fries ain't good for the heart</I>. The awareness of the above rules will increase our reasoning ability. In the terminology of knowledge engineering, we will be able to derive new facts and rules from the existing set of facts and rules. In plain language, we will know more than we have actually learned. We will be able to conclude more. We will become <I>more intelligent</I> (if intelligence was defined as <A class="external text" href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">the inferential ability of the human mind</A>). </P>
<P>Yet there is a downside to remembering the <I>trans fat rules</I>. They are not as plain as the <I>Doughnut Fact</I>, and they may not effectively be refreshed upon a sight of a doughnut. Consequently, we may simply forget the link between <I>doughnuts</I>, <I>trans fat</I>, and <I>the heart</I>. This is where SuperMemo comes to play a role. It will help you refresh the <I>trans fat rules</I>. It will minimize the number of reviews in lifetime. In other words, it will help you keep the <I>trans fat rules</I> in your forgetful memory. Thus SuperMemo makes sure that your "<I>index to knowledge</I>" remains intact in your mind. </P>

<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_Memorization_is_not_needed class=mw-headline>Myth: Memorization is not needed</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: Memorization is not needed</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: If all students followed the suggestion that memorization is not needed, we would live in a different world. Here is a humorous take on how this world might look like. </P>
<UL>
<LI>If memorization was not needed, we could travel around the world without learning languages. After all, finding out words in a dictionary takes mere seconds 
<LI>If memorization was not needed, students of medicine would not need to cram details of human anatomy and physiology. Instead they would learn to use state-of-the-art expert systems with all answers built in. If you asked: <I>What's up doc?</I> You will hear: <I>I have no idea but wait ... I will check it out on my computer</I> 
<LI>If memorization was not needed, all exams such as SAT, GRE, TEOFL, FCE, GCSE, USMLE, etc. would be a great waste of human time and resources. Students should rather come to exams with their link to the web and figure out answers <I>ad hoc</I>. Or they would just read out relevant paragraphs from a textbook 
<LI>If memorization was not needed, nobody should poke fun at George Bush Jr. for his lack of knowledge of the heads of state of Chechnya, Taiwan, or Pakistan. After all, he can find those names in seconds on his smartphone. If using external storage was permissible, nobody should blame George W. for mixing up Slovakia with Slovenia, or refer to Kosovars as Kosovarians, East Timorese as East Timorians, or Greeks as Grecians (NB: the word <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=grecian"><I>Grecians</I> is considered correct too</A>) 
<LI>If memorization was not needed, you could be a rocket scientist at NASA tomorrow! After all, rocket scientists follow well-known rules written in well-known manuals organized in a very well-known manner. If you need to plot the trajectory for Galileo to beam images of Europa back to Earth... no problem... take the <I>Advanced Calculus</I> textbook, figure it out, and send your billion dollar mission on course</LI></UL>
<P>The advantage of keeping knowledge in your head as compared to keeping it in external sources can metaphorically be compared to the advantage of going from primary through secondary to university education as opposed to getting a week-long course on digging info from external sources. Nearly all parents seem to prefer to choose the former for their kids. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_High_retention_results_in_slow_learning class=mw-headline>Myth: High retention results in slow learning</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: High retention results in slow learning</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: You need to understand a clear distinction between the two extremes of learning: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>high-retention-low-volume learning</B> (as in early versions of SuperMemo) - in which you make sure you remember 95 or more percent of the studied material 
<LI><B>low-retention-high-volume learning</B> (as in traditional forms of learning) - in which you quickly process large chunks of the material while having to struggle with massive forgetting</LI></UL>
<P>Reading books belongs to the low-retention category, while memorizing 10-20 <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1747">items</A> per day with SuperMemo belongs to the high-retention category. The optimum reading strategy will find the golden mean between these two. You should not give up traditional reading. Neither should you expect to put all your study material into SuperMemo. You should choose a middle-ground strategy. For example, if you consistently spend 90% of your time on reading and 10% of your time on adding <B>most important</B> findings to SuperMemo, your reading speed will actually decline only by some 10%, while the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1748">retention</A> of the most important pieces will be as high as programmed in SuperMemo (i.e. usually 95%). </P>
<P><A href="#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</A> provides you with a precise tool for finding the optimum balance between speed and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Retention" oldtitle="Glossary:Retention" data-hasqtip="1749">retention</A>. You will ensure high-retention of the most important pieces of text, while a large proportion of time will be spent reading at speeds comparable or higher than those typical of traditional book reading. </P>
<P>It is worth noting that the learning speed limit in high-retention learning is imposed by your memory. If "memorizing" one-book-per-year sounds like a major disappointment, the roots of this lay in human memory. Our current knowledge of psychophysiology and pharmacology does not provide any means that could allow of breaking beyond those limits. We are left with the choice between high-speed and high-retention. Incremental reading gives you a full hands-on control over finding the optimum balance. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_We_are_good_at_remembering_important_things class=mw-headline>Myth: We are good at remembering important things</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: We are good at remembering important things</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: The evolution of the brain proceeds too slowly to have helped us adapt its structures to abstract thinking. What was excellent for survival 200,000 years ago does not suffice to process modern abstract knowledge. Simple computational tasks such as multiplication or division proceed in a shamefully inefficient way in the human mind. After all, early humans did not need to multiply (explicitly and a lot). At the same time, for long, computers found it hard to compete with the visual cortex in pattern recognition and processing. Recognizing the enemy or prey was critical not only for <I>Homo sapiens</I> but also for birds, reptiles, fish or even insects. The only measure of the importance of knowledge our brain synapses have at hand is the pattern of repetition, levels of circulating hormones at the time of exposure, and a limited impact of conscious attentive labeling of information as important at the moment of encoding. Forgetting is needed to optimize knowledge storage; hence we have to forget less important things. Repeated use of the memorized knowledge is a good but far from perfect measure of importance (see: <A href="#Myth:_We_remember_useful_things_because_we_use_them">We remember useful things because we use them</A>) </P>
<P>Modern life has changed the hierarchy of value and importance of knowledge. The link between importance and repeated use has been severed. A flashy lingerie billboard we see every morning is not likely to be more important than dozens of volatile facts pertaining to our professional life. Regrettably, there is no circuit in our brain that would let us consciously etch important memories: <I>This is important! I must not forget it!</I> All we can do is to use the trick of reverberation or mnemonic techniques which... still will usually not last long unless we apply <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="1750">spaced repetition</A> as in SuperMemo. </P>
<P>If memory had an excellent ability to retain important information: </P>
<OL>
<LI>you would not tremble before an exam and confusingly run through the notes to be sure that at the zero hour you won't suffer from a blackout. At the same time, you could easily recall details of a <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzenegger">Schwarzenegger</A> movie seen last evening or even weeks before the exam. Clearly, Arnie beats the ups and downs of the <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman">Ottoman Empire</A>. And if you think the Ottoman Empire had much greater an impact on humanity than the island shootout in <I>Commando</I>, you are still likely to remember the muscle and the machine gun far better than the timeline of the sultans 
<LI>you would never have problems with recalling the date of your mother-in-law's birthday. This is a piece of data that is critical to your marital harmony! 
<LI>you should instantly forget the Olympic champions in football in Atlanta 1996 or Munich 1972. After all this might be a classic case of unimportant knowledge. Yet few Africans would forget how Nigeria beat Argentina 4:3 in 1996. Similarly, few Poles would forget the most memorable moment in the history of Polish football: Olympic championship in Munich.</LI></OL>
<P>The truth is that we excellently remember only things that are both easy to remember and repeated frequently enough. The brain does not have an internal measure of importance (other than limited volitional control or control via repeated exposure)! Your memory storage ruthlessly deletes your career-critical knowledge with the same ease as it ravages the traces of last year's golf scores or contributing names listed at the end of a boring soap opera. SuperMemo will ensure you remember your mission critical data. What is in, stays in your memory. What is out, is free to go. </P>
<H3><SPAN id=Myth:_We_remember_useful_things_because_we_use_them class=mw-headline>Myth: We remember useful things because we use them</SPAN></H3>
<P><B>Myth: We remember useful things because we use them</B>.<BR><B>Fact</B>: Not only are we limited in our ability to remember things that we consider important. We cannot even rely on the fact that frequently used memories are remembered better. There are two main reason why frequency of use is not sufficient: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B><A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1751">spacing effect</A></B> (frequently used memories may be very volatile): if you use things often, e.g. a credit card's pin code, you may surprised by a sudden unexpected <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Lapse" oldtitle="Glossary:Lapse" data-hasqtip="1752">lapse of memory</A>! The facts that are used too often or are too obvious, do not challenge the memory system well enough. They are remembered superficially. Any break from use, stress, change of context, or innocent interference from other memories may cause a sudden inability to recall a fact from memory. Even SuperMemo may not help in those cases. Those easy <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1753">items</A> often grow their <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Interval" data-hasqtip="1754">intervals</A> fast and cannot prevent the spacing effect. 
<LI><B>tunnel vision</B>: when we rely on frequently used memories, we are slow at expanding our horizons. With <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spaced_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Spaced repetition" data-hasqtip="1755">spaced repetition</A>, you can quickly grow stable and coherent knowledge into new areas. This expansion is not easy or even possible when relying on frequent use. A conscious intervention is necessary. In an extreme case, you might ask a cat why it does not master mathematics. In a cat's tunnel vision, simple goals lead to a narrow set of factual knowledge that is needed and remembered. A cat will never fly to Mars (on its own).</LI></UL>
<P>Opponents of SuperMemo often say: "<I>Whatever knowledge I need, I use often. If I use it often, I do not forget</I>". This is a false conviction. <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Spacing_effect" oldtitle="Glossary:Spacing effect" data-hasqtip="1756">Spacing effect</A> and forgetting are unpredictable. The whole world of useful things escapes your brain on a daily basis. You may say that if need to fly to Mars, you can just read about math tools that you find useful. However, the tool that is useless today might be useful in 5 years, or tomorrow, when you tackle a different problem. You need the whole toolset ready in your mind. The associative power of the extra knowledge just makes you a better problem solver and a stronger thinker. </P>
<P>Tunnel vision effect may be counteracted with extensive reading, however, there is no better way of reading than <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Incremental_reading" oldtitle="Glossary:Incremental reading" data-hasqtip="1757">incremental reading</A>. </P>
<H1><SPAN id=History_of_incremental_learning class=mw-headline>History of incremental learning</SPAN></H1>
<P>Incremental learning might be as important to SuperMemo as the original <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/General_principles_of_spaced_repetition">repetition spacing idea</A>. Incremental learning eliminates a number of bottlenecks that limit various stages of <I><A href="#Knowledge_acquisition:_Areas_of_optimization">knowledge acquisition</A></I>. </P>
<P>The name <I><A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A></I> first appeared in SuperMemo 2000. However, the concept is not new. It originated from combining our natural reading habits with the demands of <I><A title=SuperMemo href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">spaced repetition (SuperMemo)</A></I>. We rarely pick up a book and read it cover-to-cover in one go. At school we often dig through a number textbooks used for different courses. At home we stop reading a book to read a newspaper and then stop reading the newspaper to watch TV. A combination of needs and interests determines how far we go with the reading of an individual text. SuperMemo drives this concept to an extreme by letting you read just one sentence from one chapter from one book and then go on to reading <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1758">extracts</A> from a thousand books and/or articles. SuperMemo's contribution here is only the management of this multi-source reading process. As for the creative aspect of <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A>, <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</A> is known to have used the power of intermittent reading and intermittent thinking to maximize his creative output. He would keep dozens of shelves with outlines of ideas. He would return to individual shelves from time to time, esp. if he was inspired by a conversation, thinking, experiment, or reading. He would then keep reading a single shelf, think and ponder, add new notes, etc. Many of those shelves ended up as scientific publications. In that sense, <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</A> employed rudimentary <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> in his creative work. </P>
<P>The approach used in incremental reading is widely employed by many creative individuals. Even if it is far less formal that <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> or even <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Bohr</A>'s approach. <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gazzaniga">Dr Michael Gazzaniga</A> puts it this way: "<I>I think the creative process is directly related to the amount of time one spends mulling something over. I come back and revisit ideas, data, thoughts, all the time. I think this keeps key semantic networks active and then "bingo" an inconsistency or consistency suddenly presents itself to consciousness and the beginnings of a new idea appear</I>". </P>
<P>Here is a brief history of incremental reading: </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Before SuperMemo (1980)</B>: The author of SuperMemo and co-author of this incrementally written text, <A class="external text" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</A>, in his student years, used his own "cross-the-notebook" method of learning. He would go through his paper notes and cross out those he was sure he would remember for the exam. He would read his notes over and over again until all the notes have been crossed out. Each pass was faster as there was less and less to read. That method was nearly a guarantee of excellent exam results. All his lecture notes were covered with crossed out shapes that surrounded pictures and portions of text. This "granular treatment" with "processing attributes" can be thought of as an early inspiration for future <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> 
<LI><B>SuperMemo algorithm (1984-1985)</B> - The first ever attempt to measure <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Optimum_interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Optimum interval" data-hasqtip="1759">optimum intervals</A> in learning resulted in the formulation of the SuperMemo method in 1985 
<LI><B>SuperMemo 1.0 (1987)</B> - The birth of SuperMemo is also the birth of <I>computational spaced repetition</I>, i.e. the use of computers in computing <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Optimum_interval" oldtitle="Glossary:Optimum interval" data-hasqtip="1760">optimum intervals</A> in learning

Reading lists were prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts made it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions.

Other new features introduced by SuperMemo 2002: <A title="Web import" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Web_import">automatic learning material import</A> from Internet Explorer, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Mid-interval_repetition" oldtitle="Glossary:Mid-interval repetition" data-hasqtip="1767">mid-interval repetitions</A> that make it possible to review portions of material without damage to the learning process, e.g. before an exam (<A class="external text" href="https://super-memory.com/english/algsm11.htm">Algorithm SM-11</A>), <A href="#Search_and_review">search-based learning</A> (i.e. subset learning in which the subset is defined by advanced <A title="Find elements" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Find_elements">search tools</A>), dynamically modified <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1768">A-Factors</A> that fine-tune the <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1769">priorities</A> without user intervention, <A title=Postpone href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">postpone wizard</A> that makes <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Reading_list" oldtitle="Glossary:Reading list" data-hasqtip="1770">reading lists</A> obsolete, separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1771">topic</A>/<A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item" oldtitle="Glossary:Item" data-hasqtip="1772">item</A> statistics and new <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> progress statistics, <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">reference labeling</A>, and more. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2004.html">SuperMemo 2004</A></B> was developed solely with the view to perfecting the tools of <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A>. The data collected from months of actual <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> was instrumental in enhancing the algorithm and the tools. Fine tuning of the modification of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1773">topic</A> <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:A-Factor" oldtitle="Glossary:A-Factor" data-hasqtip="1774">A-Factors</A> enhanced the optimization of new material review in a heavily overloaded process. New tools included: rich statistics for monitoring and optimizing the learning process, tools for handling excessive delays in review, browsing sources of <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1775">extracts</A> and <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion" oldtitle="Glossary:Cloze deletion" data-hasqtip="1776">clozes</A>, one-key <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">reference labeling</A>, proliferating remote images, easy integration of remote images, and more. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2006.html">SuperMemo 2006</A></B> made a major step in rationalizing the material <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="1777">overload</A> in <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental learning</A> by introducing the <I><A href="#Priority_queue">priority queue</A></I>. SuperMemo 2006 made it easier to import articles from the Internet (esp. from <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>). Material <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Overload" oldtitle="Glossary:Overload" data-hasqtip="1778">overload</A> could be handled with <A href="#Auto-sort_and_auto-postpone">auto-postpone and auto-sort</A> tools. SuperMemo 2006 simplified importing, arranging, compressing, converting, zooming, and trimming pictures. SuperMemo 2006 could pick any folder on the user's disk and convert all the file archives into material that can be processed incrementally (e.g. article archives, picture archives, family albums, movie clips, documentation files, or assorted archives). SuperMemo 2006 also made it simple to do one-key searches and import of auxiliary learning material on the web with customizable tools (e.g. Google, encyclopedias, dictionaries, picture archives, etc.). 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2008.html">SuperMemo 2008</A></B> extended incremental learning into the areas of pictures, sounds and video with <A href="#Visual_learning">visual learning</A> and YouTube-based <A href="#Incremental_video">incremental video</A>. Imports from the web, esp. <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> and YouTube became simpler with set <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Priority" oldtitle="Glossary:Priority" data-hasqtip="1779">priorities</A>, <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">references</A>, <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Category" oldtitle="Glossary:Category" data-hasqtip="1780">categories</A>, etc. SuperMemo 2008 also simplified and automated the process of creating <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">source material references</A>. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo15.html">SuperMemo 15 (2011)</A></B> improved <A title="Web import" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Web_import">web imports</A> (e.g. eliminating article duplicates), splitting articles (e.g. automatic splitting of <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> articles into separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic" oldtitle="Glossary:Topic" data-hasqtip="1781">topics</A>), <A title=References href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">handling references</A>, and more. As SuperMemo 15 provided a full Unicode support, <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> in languages other than English became easier. 
<LI><B><A class="external text" href="https://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo16.html">SuperMemo 16 (2013)</A></B> consolidated all incremental learning technologies with the last two missing links: <A href="#Incremental_audio">incremental audio</A> and <A href="#Incremental_video">incremental video</A> with video files. It added more tools for <A class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A> imports (e.g. downloading full resolution pictures intead of thumbs, etc.), and <A href="#Visual_learning">visual learning</A> (e.g. global paste). It also made it possible to separate <A title="" class=glossaryEntryLink href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract" oldtitle="Glossary:Extract" data-hasqtip="1782">extracts</A> from source articles in child <A title=Browser href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser">browsers</A>. Dozens of improvements to incremental learning process convert quantity into new quality. For example, SuperMemo 16 added import from Windows (Live) Mail, or a trivial, but extremely useful <A href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</A> function: <B><A title="Component menu" href="https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu#delete_before_cursor">Delete before cursor</A></B>.
