<P>It was Sunday.<BR>I never get up early on Sundays.<BR>I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime.<BR>Last Sunday I got up very late.<BR>I looked out of the window.<BR>It was dark outside.<BR>'What a day!' I thought.<BR>'It's raining again.'<BR>Just then, the telephone rang.<BR>It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said.<BR>'I'm coming to see you.'<BR>'But I'm still having breakfast.' I said.<BR>'What are you doing?' she asked.<BR>'I'm having breakfast.' I repeated.<BR>'Dear me,' she said. <BR>'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'
