<P>I had an amusing experience last year.<BR>After I had left a small village in the south of France,<BR>I drove on to the next town.<BR>On the way, a young man waved to me.<BR>I stopped and he asked me for a lift.<BR>As soon as he had got into the car, &#65288;&#20070;&#19978;&#26159;&#20004;&#20010;as&#65292;&#24405;&#38899;&#23569;&#20102;&#19968;&#20010;as&#65289;<BR>I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language.<BR>Apart from a few words, <BR>I do not know any French at all.<BR>Neither of us spoke during the journey.<BR>I had nearly reached the town, <BR>when the young man suddenly said, <BR>very slowly, 'Do you speak English?'<BR>As I soon learnt, he was English himself!
