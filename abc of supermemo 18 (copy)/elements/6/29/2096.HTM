<P>Why do people think the writer is mad?</P>
<P>Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad.<BR>I live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day.<BR>The airport was built years ago, <BR>but for some reason it could not be used then.<BR>Last year, however, it came into use.<BR>Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise.<BR>I am one of the few people left. <BR>Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane.<BR>I have been offered a large sum of money to go away, <BR>but I am determined to stay here.<BR>Everybody says I must be mad and they are probably right.
