<P>After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag.<BR>I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there!<BR>As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.</P>
<P>'Did you have a good meal?' he asked.<BR>'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'</P>
<P>The landlord smiled and immediately went out.<BR>In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.</P>
<P>'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!'
