<P>Why is the new house special?</P>
<P>I had a letter from my sister yesterday.<BR>She lives in Nigeria.<BR>In her letter, she said that she would come to England next year.<BR>If she comes, she will get a surprise.<BR>We are now living in a beautiful new house in the country.<BR>Work on it had begun before my sister left.<BR>The house was completed five months ago.<BR>In my letter, I told her that she could stay with us.<BR>The house has many large rooms and there is a lovely garden.<BR>It is a very modern house, so it looks strange to some people.<BR>It must be the only modern house in the district.
