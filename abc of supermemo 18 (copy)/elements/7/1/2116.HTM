<P>Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under control. <BR>A short time before, great trees had covered the countryside for miles around.<BR>Now, smoke still rose up from the warm ground over the desolate hills.<BR>Winter was coming on and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, <BR>for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well.<BR>When the fire had at last been put out, <BR>the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly.<BR>The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes.<BR>The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain.<BR>By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root.<BR>In place of the great trees which had been growing there for centuries, <BR>patches of green had begun to appear in the blackened soil.
