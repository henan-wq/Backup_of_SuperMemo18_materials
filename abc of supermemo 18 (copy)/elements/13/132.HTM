<P>In this article I would like to discuss the optimum strategy that would <B>maximize the inflow of quality knowledge into the learning process at minimum time</B>. It should be noted that long-term memory is still the bottleneck of the learning process. Consequently, your chief cost in learning will be paid to repetitions (i.e. the effort of keeping knowledge in memory). Yet a noticeable proportion of your time is spent on importing knowledge to <A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</A> and formulating it for optimum recall. Actually, this fraction of your learning effort will often be most painful and inhibitory. Many would-be-users complain that they do not employ SuperMemo because <I>it takes too long to type in the learning material to the program</I>. This article is an attempt to suggest a set of solutions (other than the obvious one: get <A href="http://www.super-memory.com/sml/sml.htm">ready-made learning material</A>)</P>
<P>New <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/read.htm">reading options</A> and a wider application of <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/texts.htm">rich text and HTML components</A> in SuperMemo 99 through 2002 are likely to influence the way in which you acquire new knowledge with SuperMemo. In early versions of <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/soft/sm6.htm">SuperMemo for DOS</A>, all knowledge was represented as questions and answers in limited-length text fields. This required lots of discipline in formulating items and there was no intermediate stage between the outside sources of knowledge, and the knowledge stored in SuperMemo</P>
<P>Today, SuperMemo makes it possible to import entire articles in electronic form, extract most important fragments, gradually process these fragments at speeds that reflect the importance of particular pieces of knowledge</P>
<P>A collection in SuperMemo becomes a conglomerate of pieces of knowledge of various priority, status and degree of processing.&nbsp;Consequently, SuperMemo 99/2002 adds the following new qualities to learning:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Faster learning:</B> You can quickly introduce rough notes into SuperMemo and later gradually convert them into well-structured knowledge. This is prioritizing via formulation. Less important material may remain unstructured and, as such, less well remembered. You will see how passive notes gradually fade in your memory and how their individual components will need to be reinforced by formulating specific well-structured items. You will make such reinforcement decisions on the one by one basis depending on the importance of the fading material and the degree of recall problems (see examples below)
<P>&nbsp;</P></LI>
<LI><B>Better understanding: </B>You can gradually build understanding of complex phenomena. You will start from importing a set of unrelated or even chaotic articles describing a studied complex problem. You can then gradually proceed through this material and gradually build the understanding from basic or simple facts towards details or more complex components of knowledge
<P>&nbsp;</P></LI>
<LI><B>Creative thinking: </B>You can gradually resolve contradictions in a body of knowledge. If you study a new branch of science with a number of contradictory findings and models, you will find SuperMemo quite useful in grappling with contradictions. By introducing the chaos of new research into SuperMemo, you will gradually locate contradictions and strive at building better and more consistent models in your memory. You will build understanding, resolve contradictions and ultimately creatively discover new truths about the learned material. You will quickly lean towards theories that are better supported by research findings. Those supported poorly will be less firm and will often cause recall problems. You can reformulate or delete these. As you process the material, the creative build-up will be gradual and you will intelligently manage the flow of knowledge in your collection<BR></LI></OL>
<P>SuperMemo 2002 encourages you to (1) collect rough notes from various sources, and (2) introduce these notes into the learning process (even before these notes assume the ultimate well-structured shape). Such rough notes will often <B>not </B>comply with the two pivotal principles of SuperMemo:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B><A name="active recall">active recall principle</A></B>: passive presentation of knowledge is ineffective. Instead of reading that <I>Theodore Roosevelt won the Nobel peace prize in 1906 for mediating in the Russo-Japanese war </I>we should be asked <I>Who won the Nobel peace prize in 1906 for mediating in the Russo-Japanese war? </I>or <I>Which year did Theodore Roosevelt win the Nobel peace prize?</I>, etc.</LI>
<LI><B><A name="minimum information principle">minimum information principle</A>: </B>the act of recall in a single repetition should be accompanied by minimum added effort related to reading comments, wordy questions, etc. Each recall, i.e. each repetition, should refer to a single fact or rule: a single basic memory unit</LI></UL>
<P>In this article I would like to stress that the approach in which you store rough notes and text fragments in SuperMemo does not have to contradict the principles of effective learning. Indeed, the new tools provided in SuperMemo 2000 encourage this approach and assist you in efficient knowledge management. SuperMemo 2000 helps you build better understanding of complex material and creatively resolve contradictions in knowledge you learn</P>
<P>Here are some typical ways knowledge enters your SuperMemo collection:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Articles: </B>If you find an interesting article on the web, CD-ROM encyclopedia, or any other article available in electronic form, you can copy it to the clipboard, and paste it to SuperMemo with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/edit.htm">Edit</A> : Add a new article </B>(<I>Ctrl+Alt+N)</I>. Note that you need to enter the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/levels.htm">professional level</A> to make this possible (<B>File : <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/levels.htm">Level</A> : Professional</B>)</LI>
<LI><B>Items:</B> If you want to add a single important piece of information belonging to a well-defined <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/categs.htm">category</A>, you can select this category in the <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/toolsbar.htm">category combo-box</A>, choose <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/addnew.htm">Add new</A></B> and type in the contents of the item. Usually, you will formulate a question and an answer. Occasionally, you will import a file to illustrate your item (e.g. if your category <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/templates.htm">template</A> includes an image component, you can import a <I>jpg </I>or <I>gif</I> file with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Import_file">Import file</A></B>). In earlier versions of SuperMemo, adding items was the primary way of expanding your study material</LI>
<LI><B>Notes: </B>If you want to quickly introduce some rough notes taken while watching TV, reading press, during a lecture, board meeting, or meeting with a friend, you can define a separate <I>To Do</I> category that will allow of the fastest possible transfer of rough notes into the learning process (see <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Creating a To Do category">yellow inset below</A> to find out how to set up a <I>To Do </I>category). Your <I>To Do </I>category might use a question and answer template based on Rich Text components (RTF format). Using Rich Text will help you process knowledge gradually depending on the priority and availability of time. If you frequently add sounds or images to your items, your <I>To Do </I>template might include a sound component and one or more image components. In SuperMemo 2002, you can add a new note with <B>Edit : Add to category : Note </B>(<I>Alt+N</I>)</LI></OL>

<P>Instead of creating one <I>To Do</I> template, you may create a separate template for including pictures (e.g. <I>To Do Picture</I>), separate for sounds, videos, etc. You can also create a special template for occlusion tests (i.e. graphic deletion tests), in which you will cover a part of a picture with a rectangle at question time and reveal the covered area at answer. You could then name such a template <I>To Do Occlusion</I> for easy reference (see the inset <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Occlusion test">Occlusion test </A></B><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Occlusion test">below</A>).

<P>Depending on the way you introduce knowledge to SuperMemo, its further processing will look quite different:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Articles: </B>If you have pasted an entire article from an electronic text, you will use options such as <B>Remember extract</B>,<B> Task extract</B>, or <B>Queue extract </B>to generated smaller and more manageable pieces of information. For a detailed discussion see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/devour.htm">Devouring knowledge</A>, <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm">Reading the Internet</A>, and <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/read.htm">Incremental reading</A></LI>
<LI><B>Items: </B>If you have added a well-structured element to its target category, it will most likely need little further processing except for minor corrections, editing, etc. A subset of these elements will naturally be rescheduled, removed from the learning process, dismissed or even deleted; however, the scale of these actions will be incomparably less than in the case of the next category, i.e. rough notes</LI>
<LI><B>Notes:</B> If you have added a rough note to your <I>To Do </I>category, it will require further processing that will include: 
<UL>
<LI>splitting into smaller fragments</LI>
<LI>rewording</LI>
<LI>generating cloze deletions</LI>
<LI>converting to a simple question-and-answer format</LI>
<LI>moving to appropriate categories (and perhaps merging with the category template at the same time)</LI>
<LI>introducing the item to or removing it from the learning process, etc.</LI></UL></LI></OL>
<P>The gray insert presents a couple of examples of real-life situations, which could result in adding rough notes to your <I>To Do</I> category. Your choices will naturally depend on your interests and needs. You may opt to use SuperMemo to learn professional knowledge only, or languages, or proverbs, jokes, family names, history, or knowledge that you have long forgotten since your high school years (see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#User comments">User Comments</A> to better understand the knowledge selection issue)</P>

<P>Your notes will probably be added to the pending queue; however, once your pending queue grows long enough, you will want to immediately memorize those notes that are particularly important&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once you memorize your notes, they will come back to you for review in the learning process. Depending on the importance of a given note you will most likely choose one of the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>If the note contains very important material, you will immediately convert the note to a set of well-structured items (<FONT size=3>see <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#Step 2">further examples in gray insets</A></FONT>)</LI>
<LI>On a less important note, you can postpone the review by choosing a passing grade (as in standard repetitions). Naturally, each time you postpone processing your note, the interval before the next review will grow larger at each repetition. Soon you will notice, that delicate fabric of memory structure that keeps the note in your memory falls apart as a result of passive review (only <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/g.htm#active_recall">active recall</A></B> can ensure good retention). If you postpone processing the note 4-5 times, the interval might be long enough for you to come to the conclusion that you should either delete the note (you seem not to have time to process it) or process it only partly (e.g. using cloze deletion options on most important keywords)</LI>
<LI>Occasionally, you can manually decide when to schedule the next review by choosing <B>Jump interval </B>(<I>Ctrl+J)</I></LI>
<LI>You can shift the note back to the pending queue with <I>Ctrl+R. </I>This way, it will be processed only after you pass all the remaining items in the pending queue</LI>
<LI>You can dismiss the note with <I>Ctrl+D</I>. This way you will come back to the note only if you locate it with search (e.g. <I>Ctrl+F</I>) or stumble against it accidentally</LI>
<LI>You can delete the note if you believe it is not important enough or if you think that you are not likely to ever convert it to well-structured items. Keeping notes indefinitely in the learning process is a poor strategy that is likely to pollute your repetitions and reduce your focus (you may find yourself reviewing less relevant old notes that leave little traces in your memory while you could better use this time for retaining quality knowledge)</LI></OL>
<P>Processing notes is not an <I>all or nothing</I> process. If you notice that upon third or fourth review, important components of the note seem to fall apart in your memory, you can, for example, pick a single keyword and use it with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Reading">Reading</A> : Remember cloze </B>to memorize one cloze deletion that will effectively restore this particular semantic relationship in your memory. You could also use <B>Reading : Remember extract </B>to extract only the most important sentence that will later be subject to the same review process</P>

<P>It is easy to notice that the process of formulating items above has not been completed.

In a well-managed learning process, all notes and extracts will ultimately be used to generate well-structured items and dismissed (for future reference) or deleted (if no longer needed). As all new items are built from clozes and extracts as children of the parent extract or note, the actual deleting of a rough note should take place only after all children have been moved to their target categories</P>

<P>You will often need many occlusion tests generated from a single picture. In such cases you will reuse the same geographical map or anatomical chart or a conceptual mind-map to generate a number of questions (note that your picture <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/reguse.htm">will not be physically duplicated</A> and this procedure will not consume much of your precious hard disk space).

<P>The flow of knowledge in SuperMemo proceeds along the four major pathways that make up a complex multidimensional flow of knowledge:&nbsp;</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Quality flow </B>- flow of knowledge from articles and notes, through extracts to cloze deletions and well-structured items</LI>
<LI><B>Pool flow </B>- flow of knowledge from reading lists and pending notes towards the pool of pending elements and ultimately memorized elements. Occasionally, some elements will move to the dismissed pool for future reference. Processed articles and extracts will often be deleted for the sake of conserving space and avoiding excessively rich searches in your collection</LI>
<LI><B>Category flow </B>- flow of elements from your <I>To Do </I>category to other categories such as: <I>biology, geography, history, economics, private, Internet,</I> etc.&nbsp;</LI>
<LI><B>Time flow</B> - flow of elements in time from shorter to longer intervals. Because of the fact that a large proportion of processing is done at repetitions, flow of knowledge towards longer intervals slows down the three remaining flow pathways&nbsp;</LI></OL><B>Quality flow</B> 
<P>Quality flow proceeds from articles and from rough notes, through stray images and text fragments towards cloze deletions and well-structures items based on <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#active recall">active recall</A> and <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm#minimum information principle">minimum information:<BR></A></P>
<OL>
<LI><B>articles </B>enter SuperMemo via reading lists. Once you locate interesting texts in electronic form, you can import them via the clipboard using <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/edit.htm">Edit</A> : Add a new article</B> (<I>Ctrl+Alt+R</I>). While reading an article you extract its fragments (e.g. with <B>Reading : Remember extract</B>) that later enter the review process. For a detailed discussion of reading lists see: <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm">Reading the Internet</A></LI>
<LI><B>extracts </B>are best added to your <I>To Do </I>category based on rich text templates. Using rich text makes it easier to process extracts. Further extractions and cloze deletions leave a permanent colored-font mark in the extract so that you do not have to keep wondering which parts of the extract have already been processed. Here are the three typical ways extract enter SuperMemo: 
<OL>
<LI>as extractions from larger articles with <B>Reading : Remember extract </B>or <B>Reading : Queue extract</B></LI>
<LI>as pasted via clipboard directly from longer electronic articles (e.g. collected on the net, e-mail, CD-ROM encyclopedia, etc.). Reading lists are best suited for meaty articles full of contents that requires meticulous processing. However, you will often read longer articles that will only sparsely contribute to your knowledge. Very often, a whole article will have zero contribution or will contribute a single paragraph. In such cases, importing it to your reading list would be a waste of your time or a waste of space in your collection (reading lists make your collections swell quickly into dozens of megabytes!). For sparse articles, select the paragraph of interest in your web browser, choose <I>Ctrl+C </I>(copy to clipboard), switch to SuperMemo, select <I>To Do </I>category, choose <I>Ctrl+A</I> to add a new note and paste the content of the copied paragraph (e.g. with <I>Shift+Ins</I> or <I>Ctrl+V</I>)</LI>
<LI>as typed in directly from other sources (e.g. press, TV, books, phone talk, etc.). Very often you will need to type a note quickly without much time to consider the appropriate formulation for learning. Using techniques described in this article, you will later convert such notes to well-formulated learning material</LI></OL></LI>
<LI><B>sentences, pictures, sounds, etc. </B>are best added to the <I>To Do</I> category. Once you encounter an important sentence or phrase, you will quickly paste it in to a new item or type it in (in case it was not available electronically). The same happens with pictures that illustrate an important idea. Once you locate a picture on the net, you can save it on your disk, add a new item, use the <I>To Do Picture </I>template on that item, and use <B>Import file</B> to import the picture to this new item (do not paste images via clipboard as this will store them in space-consuming <I>BMP</I> format)</LI>
<LI><B>cloze deletions </B>will most likely be created from extracts and sentences still located in the <I>To Do </I>category. Optimally, <I>To Do</I> category should be rich-text based. This will make it easy to see which parts of a given extract have already been processed with cloze deletions. On the other hand, template in target categories would better be plain-text based. Text components use much less space and have quite a number of other <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/guide.htm#Which_text_components_are_for_you.3F">advantages</A>&nbsp;</LI>
<LI><B>questions and answers </B>will either be added directly to the target category in the ultimate shape or will be produced from cloze deletion items after careful analysis of the wording and formulation. Well-processed cloze deletions from <I>To Do</I> branch can be moved to the target category by choosing the category in the <B>Category </B>combo box in the <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/elparam.htm">Element parameters </A></B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/elparam.htm">dialog box</A> (<I>Ctrl+Shift+P</I>)</LI></OL>

<LI><B>tasks</B> - tasks will usually have a form of articles and article extracts placed on your <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm">reading lists</A>. Tasks do not take part in repetitions and are scheduled for review in prioritized lists called <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/taskman.htm">tasklists</A>. You pick tasks for reading with <B>Learn : Reading list </B>(<I>Ctrl+F4</I>) and remove them from the list after reading with <B>Dismiss </B>(<I>Ctrl+D)</I>. Fragments of articles may enter other pools of knowledge by means of <A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/read.htm">reading functions</A></LI>
<LI><B>pending elements </B>- rough notes and items that await the entry into the learning process.

<LI><B>memorized elements</B> - elements that take part in repetitions.

<LI><B>dismissed elements</B> - elements that you consciously eliminate from the learning process and keep in your collection only for reference or archival purposes</LI>

<P align=left><FONT size=2>The horizontal axis corresponds with the repetition number and the vertical axis represents intervals (logarithmic scale). Despite popular belief, the semi-log scale does not produce a linear graph here. Clearly the increase in the length of intervals slows down with successive repetitions. Moreover, the graph corresponding with zero lapses (black curve), results from the superposition of items with lower and faster increase in intervals (determined by difficulty). The bell-shaped curve is determined by all contributing items (below repetition number 10) and then only by difficult items or items with low forgetting index for which the increase in the length of intervals is significantly slower (above repetition 10).

<P><B>Flow dynamics</B></P>
<P>The quality flow is unidirectional, i.e. you gradually move from unprocessed articles and rough notes towards quality knowledge that takes part in the learning process. Category flow is also unidirectional: from unprocessed reading branches to well-formulated category branches.</P>
<P>The pool flow is more complex and often multidirectional. New elements usually start off as tasks in the reading lists, rough notes added to the pending queue or important notes added directly to the learning process (memorized pool). Articles and extracts stored in the reading list (task pool) are dismembered into shorter extracts that flow into memorized or pending pool, while articles themselves are tossed into the dismissed pool upon review (usually they are not deleted until children elements formed during reading are completely processed and moved into target categories; the process that may take months). Pending elements gradually move to the memorized pool (usually at the speed determined by the availability of time for learning). Memorized elements may flow back to the pending queue (if they are considered of lower priority) or into the dismissed pool (if they are considered worth future reference but not worth remembering). Some memorized elements will be deleted if they become irrelevant or are considered no longer needed&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT size=3>You should remember that all items introduced into your learning process require endless attention in reference to their applicability, formulation, importance, logic, etc. In a well-planned learning process, it should not be necessary to review items in the periods between individual repetitions. However, when an item comes up in a repetition, you should make a quick and nearly instinctive assessment of the following:</FONT> </P>
<OL>
<LI><I><FONT size=3>Do I really need this item?</FONT></I></LI>
<LI><I><FONT size=3>Do I really need to know it now? Or can I remove it from my memory for some time?</FONT></I></LI>

<LI><I><FONT size=3>Is it as simple and clear as it could be?</FONT></I></LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=3>Here are some typical actions you will take depending on the answer to the above questions:</FONT> 
<OL>
<LI><B><FONT size=3>editing</FONT></B> <FONT size=3>the item. In case of questions and answer, you will use keys such as <I>Q, A</I>, or <I>E</I> to enter a desired text field and edit it. In more complex items you will use <I>Ctrl+T </I>to circle between components, <I>Alt+click</I> to switch a component between editing and dragging modes, or <I>Ctrl+E </I>to enter the editing mode</FONT></LI>
<LI><B><FONT size=3>forgetting </FONT></B><FONT size=3>the item. If you think the item is too difficult or not important enough, you can postpone learning it. For this purpose, press <I>Ctrl+R</I> to remove it from the learning process. This will put the item at the end of the pending queue (i.e. the queue of elements that await the entry into the learning process)</FONT></LI>
<LI><B><FONT size=3>rescheduling </FONT></B><FONT size=3>the item. If you know the item well or for some other reason want to manually increase (or decrease) the length of the inter-repetition interval, press <I>Ctrl+J</I> to select the date of the next repetition</FONT></LI>
<LI><B><FONT size=3>dismissing </FONT></B><FONT size=3>the item. If you are sure you are not likely to need the item in the future, but you would like to keep it in your collection for reference or archival purposes, press <I>Ctrl+D</I>. Dismissed items are removed from the learning process and from the pending queue. If you create a reading list item and process it gradually (e.g. with <B><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Reading">Reading : Remember extract</A></B>), you will want to leave it in your collection until all its children are processed (e.g. moved to appropriate categories). SuperMemo will automatically prompt you once the last child of such an item is moved or deleted. You will then be able to choose if you still want to keep the parent item in the collection</FONT></LI>
<LI><B><FONT size=3>deleting</FONT></B> <FONT size=3>the item. The key <I>Del</I> is very useful in cleaning your collection from garbage that results from your desire to know more than your memory can hold. In editing mode or in spelling items (i.e. at times when <I>Del </I>plays text editing functions), you may need to use <I>Ctrl+Shift+Del</I> instead of <I>Del</I>.

I passionately learn English. Memorizing proper names, dates, numbers and other dry facts sounds like a pretty good way to waste my time. I am not convinced<BR><FONT size=3><B>Answer:</B><BR>The only rational approach to deciding which material should enter your collection is via the cost-benefit analysis. With a dose of practice, this analysis becomes a semi-automatic process, and should painlessly blend with your life. The cost-benefit analysis should serve as the sole platform for deciding what is worth adding to SuperMemo, and what is not (neglecting the fact that your learning may also be a form of enjoyable pastime). The cost-benefit criterion is: <B>if costs of not knowing a piece of knowledge is greater than the cost of repetitions in a given period of time, add this piece of knowledge to SuperMemo </B>(otherwise do not add it)</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=3>Cost</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Cost of a single well-structured item in lifetime ranges roughly from 40 seconds to 3 minutes. At any given moment it may be approximated for a 30-year bracket, by multiplying <B>Future repetitions</B> (in <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm">element data</A>) by <B>Avg time</B> (in <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/statistics.htm">learning statistics</A>). In SuperMemo 2000, this value is already displayed for you in <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm">element data</A>.&nbsp; If your item is ill-structured (i.e. difficult to remember), this cost may bloat!!! To eliminate ill-structured items use <A href="https://super-memory.com/help/leech.htm">leech analysis</A></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT size=3>Benefit</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Each piece of knowledge in your collections should be associated with a tangible benefit. Only <B>you</B> can accurately guess the value. For example, the value of memorizing the opening hours of your gym in a given time might be approximated by multiplying (1) the probability you will choose wrong hours by (2) the time-cost of missing the gym. For example, if you believe that the probability is 25% and the cost of choosing wrong hours is 40 minutes, the cost of knowing the opening hours is around 10 minutes. In such a case, memorizing the opening hours will be cheaper than missing the gym. However, if the probability is sufficiently low or the time loss sufficiently small, you should not add opening hours to SuperMemo. For example, if the probability is 10% and time loss is 3 minutes, you are not likely to recover your learning investment! There are naturally less clear-cut cases in-between. Use your best knowledge to figure out the outcome</FONT></P></DIV>
